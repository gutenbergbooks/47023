<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="sc">My Dear Boys</span>:</p>
<p>This tale is complete in itself, but forms volume
three in a line issued under the general
title of &ldquo;Putnam Hall Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This series was started at the request of many
boys and girls who had read some volumes of
the &ldquo;Rover Boys&rsquo; Series,&rdquo; and who wanted to
know what had taken place at Putnam Hall previous
to the arrival there of the three Rover
brothers. When the Rovers came on the scene
Putnam Hall had been flourishing for some time
and was filled with bright, go-ahead cadets, who
had been mixed up in innumerable scrapes, and
who had gone through quite a few adventures.
My young friends wanted to hear all about these
wideawake lads, and for their benefit I started
this series.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>In the first volume, called &ldquo;The Putnam Hall
Cadets,&rdquo; I told just how the school came to be
founded, and related many of the adventures of
Jack Ruddy, Pepper Ditmore, and their chums.
In the second volume, entitled &ldquo;The Putnam Hall
Rivals,&rdquo; the doings of these cadets were again
followed, and I also told the particulars of a
queer balloon ride and of a remarkable discovery
in the woods.</p>
<p>In the present story I have endeavored to show
something of what the Putnam Hall boys could
do when it came to contests on the lake, in the
gymnasium, and elsewhere. A large portion of
the cadets&rsquo; &ldquo;off time&rdquo; was devoted to sports, and
the rivalry, both in the academy and against other
schools, was of the keenest. Mixed in with the
rivalry was a generous share of fun, and what
some of this hilarity led to I leave the pages
which follow to tell.</p>
<p>Once again I thank my young friends for the
interest they have shown in my stories. I trust
the reading of this volume will please you all.</p>
<p>Affectionately and sincerely yours,</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Arthur M. Winfield</span>.</span></p>

<h1 title="">THE PUTNAM HALL CHAMPIONS</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">A RACE ON THE LAKE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about a life on the ocean wave, Pep;
isn&rsquo;t this good enough for anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is, Jack,&rdquo; answered Pepper Ditmore.
&ldquo;And I think the <i>Alice</i> is going to prove
a dandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Alice</i> a dandy?&rdquo; came from a third
youth aboard the sloop. &ldquo;How can you make
that out? Girls aren&rsquo;t dandies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this girl is a boat,&rdquo; put in a fourth youth.
&ldquo;Say, has anybody got an apple he doesn&rsquo;t
want?&rdquo; he went on, looking from one to another
of his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Stuffer, aren&rsquo;t you filled up yet?&rdquo; demanded
Jack Ruddy, who had hold of the tiller
of the craft that was speeding up the lake. &ldquo;To
my certain knowledge you have eaten ten apples
already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ten?&rdquo; snorted Paul Singleton, who was often
called Stuffer because of his love of eating. &ldquo;Not
a bit of it! I&rsquo;ve only had four&mdash;and two were
very small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another&mdash;my last,&rdquo; cried Pepper, and
threw the apple to his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Jack, I want to ask a question,&rdquo;
said Dale Blackmore. &ldquo;Why did you call the
new sloop the <i>Alice</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name of his best girl,&rdquo; answered Pepper,
promptly. &ldquo;Why do you ask foolish questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any best girl and you know it,&rdquo;
retorted Jack Ruddy. &ldquo;I named the sloop after
my cousin, Alice Smith. Her father, my uncle,
gave me the boat. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, here comes another sloop!&rdquo; cried Paul
Singleton, looking across the lake. &ldquo;Wonder
what boat that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a big P on the mainsail,&rdquo; answered Dale
Blackmore. &ldquo;Must belong to some of the Pornell
Academy fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that boat&mdash;heard about her when I
was in town yesterday,&rdquo; said Pepper Ditmore.
&ldquo;She belongs to a fellow of Pornell named Fred
Century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Imp, is he a hundred years old?&rdquo;
queried Dale, with a grimace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. He&rsquo;s only a little older than I am.
The sloop is named the <i>Ajax</i>, and Century claims
she is the swiftest thing that was ever launched
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly looks as if she could make
time,&rdquo; was Dale Blackmore&rsquo;s critical comment,
as he gazed at the approaching craft, with her
snowy spread of sails. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she is quite
as wide as the <i>Alice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is every bit as long,&rdquo; came from Paul
Singleton. &ldquo;And her sails are every bit as big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sloop ahoy!&rdquo; came a hail from the approaching
craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, the <i>Ajax</i>!&rdquo; answered Jack Ruddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the new boat from Putnam Hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought it might be,&rdquo; went on Fred Century,
as he came closer. &ldquo;This is the new boat
from Pornell Academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know that,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Fine-looking
sloop, too,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to race?&rdquo; asked another youth
aboard the <i>Ajax</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn&rsquo;t come out to race,&rdquo; answered
the young owner of the <i>Alice</i>. &ldquo;We just came
out for a quiet sail. We&rsquo;ve got to be back to
the Hall by six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are afraid to race you, Fred,&rdquo; said
another boy aboard the <i>Ajax</i>. &ldquo;They know you
can beat them out of their boots.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us race them, Jack,&rdquo; whispered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use of racing if the <i>Alice</i> isn&rsquo;t in proper
condition,&rdquo; interrupted Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all right&mdash;but I like to go over
everything before a race,&rdquo; said Jack, a bit doubtfully.
&ldquo;Some of the blocks work rather stiffly,
and I haven&rsquo;t quite got the swing of this tiller
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to race or not?&rdquo; cried a third boy
aboard the <i>Ajax</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you are afraid of being
beaten&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Fred Century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come out just for the purpose of
racing?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hardly,&rdquo; said the owner of the <i>Ajax</i>.
&ldquo;We just saw you, and thought you&rsquo;d like a little
brush, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far do you want to race?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, what do you say to Cat Point and
from there to Borden&rsquo;s Cove? The first sloop to
reach the white rock at the cove is to be the
winner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; answered Fred Century, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll beat you by half a mile!&rdquo; sang out one
of the boys aboard the Pornell boat, a lad named
Will Carey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better do your blowing after the race is over,&rdquo;
answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll beat you all right enough,&rdquo; said the
owner of the Pornell boat. &ldquo;This sloop of mine
is going to be the queen of this lake, and don&rsquo;t
you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few words more were spoken&mdash;as to how
the boats should round Cat Point&mdash;and then the
race was started. There was a favorable breeze,
and each craft let out its mainsail to the fullest
and likewise the topsail and the jib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are carrying four passengers while they
are only carrying three,&rdquo; said Dale, when the
race was on in earnest. &ldquo;We should have made
them take some extra ballast aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The course mapped out was about two miles
in one direction and two miles in another. At
the start of the race the <i>Alice</i> had a little the
better of it, but before half a mile had been
covered the <i>Ajax</i> came crawling up and then
passed the Putnam Hall boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where we leave you behind!&rdquo; sang
out Fred Century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show you a clean pair of heels over the
whole course,&rdquo; added Will Carey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as you are ready to give up the race,
blow your fog-horn,&rdquo; said Bat Sedley, the third
member of the party aboard the <i>Ajax</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear no fog-horn to-day,&rdquo; answered
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; shouted Fred Century, and then
his sloop took an extra spurt and went ahead a
distance of a hundred yards or more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, we&rsquo;ve got to beat them!&rdquo; murmured
Pepper. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never get done crowing,&rdquo; finished
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best,&rdquo; answered the youthful
owner of the <i>Alice</i>. &ldquo;This race has only started.&rdquo;
And then he moved the tiller a trifle, to bring his
boat on a more direct course for Cat Point.</p>
<p>To those who have read the previous volumes
in this &ldquo;Putnam Hall Series&rdquo; the boys aboard
the <i>Alice</i> need no special introduction. For the
benefit of those who now meet them for the first
time I would state that they were all pupils at
Putnam Hall military academy, a fine institution
of learning, located on the shore of Cayuga Lake,
in New York State. Of the lads Jack Ruddy was
a little the oldest. He was a well-built and handsome
boy, and had been chosen as major of the
school battalion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s bosom companion was Pepper Ditmore,
often called Imp, because he loved to play pranks.
Pepper was such a wideawake, jolly youth you
could not help but love him, and he had a host
of friends.</p>
<p>Putnam Hall had been built by Captain Victor
Putnam, a retired officer of the United States
Army, who had seen strenuous service for Uncle
Sam in the far West. The captain had had considerable
money left to him, and with this he had
purchased ten acres of land on the shore of the
lake and erected his school, a handsome structure
of brick and stone, containing many class-rooms,
a large number of dormitories, and likewise a
library, mess-room, or dining hall, an office, and
other necessary apartments. There was a beautiful
campus in front of the building and a parade
ground to one side. Towards the rear were a
gymnasium and several barns, and also a boathouse,
fronting the lake. Beyond, around a curve
of the shore, were fields cultivated for the benefit
of the Hall, and further away were several
patches of woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>As was but natural in the case of an old army
officer, Captain Putnam had organized his school
upon military lines, and his students made up a
battalion of two companies, as related in details
in the first volume of this series, called &ldquo;The Putnam
Hall Cadets.&rdquo; The students had voted for
their own officers, and after a contest that was
more or less spirited, Jack Ruddy was elected
major of the battalion, and a youth named Henry
Lee became captain of Company A, and Bart
Conners captain of Company B. Some of the
boys wanted Pepper to try for an officer&rsquo;s position,
but he declined, stating he would just as
lief remain &ldquo;a high private in the rear rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the school there was a big youth named
Dan Baxter, who was a good deal of a bully. He
had wanted to be an officer, and it made him very
sore to see himself defeated. Together with a
crony named Nick Paxton and a boy called
Mumps he plotted to break up a picnic of Jack
and his friends. This plot proved a boomerang,
and after that Baxter and his cohorts did all they
could to get Jack and his chums into trouble.</p>
<p>The first assistant teacher at the Hall was
Josiah Crabtree, a man of good education, but
one who was decidedly sour in his make-up and
who never knew how to take fun. With him the
cadets were continually in &ldquo;hot water,&rdquo; and more
than once the boys wished Crabtree would leave
Putnam Hall never to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The second assistant teacher was George
Strong, and he was as much beloved as the first
assistant was despised. George Strong had not
forgotten the time when he was a boy himself,
and he often came out on the lake or the athletic
field, or in the gymnasium, to take part in their
sports and pastimes. Pepper voted him &ldquo;the
prince of good teachers,&rdquo; and Jack and the others
endorsed this sentiment.</p>
<p>During the first session of Putnam Hall,
George Strong had mysteriously disappeared.
Two strange men had been seen around the
school, and it was learned that the strangers had
something to do with the missing instructor. A
hunt was instituted by Captain Putnam, and in
this he was joined by Jack, Pepper, Dale, and an
acrobatic pupil named Andy Snow. George
Strong was found to be a prisoner in a hut in
the woods, and it was learned that his captors
were the two strange men. These men were
related distantly to the teacher and both were
insane&mdash;their minds having been affected by the
loss of their fortunes.</p>
<p>After the insane men were cared for George
Strong told the cadets about a pot of gold which
his ancestors had buried during the Revolutionary
War. One day some of the cadets took a
balloon ride, as related in detail in the second
volume of this series, entitled &ldquo;The Putnam Hall
Rivals,&rdquo; and this ride brought them to a strange
part of the woods near the lake. Here they came
on some landmarks which had been mentioned to
them, and to their joy unearthed the pot of gold
coins. For this find the cadets were rewarded
by George Strong, and the teacher became a
closer friend to the boys than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Dan Baxter had been called away from Putnam
Hall by his father. He had had a fierce
fight with Pepper and gotten the worst of it, and
he was, consequently, glad enough to disappear
for the time being. But he left behind him many
of his cronies, and three of these, Reff Ritter,
Gus Coulter, and Nick Paxton, vowed they would
&ldquo;square accounts&rdquo; with the Imp and also with
his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan to make Pep Ditmore eat
humble pie,&rdquo; said Reff Ritter, one day. And
then he related some of the details to Coulter
and Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; cried Coulter. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t
leave out Jack Ruddy. I&rsquo;d rather get square
with Ruddy than anybody. He has been down
on me ever since I came to the Hall. I hate him
like poison.&rdquo; And Gus Coulter&rsquo;s face took on a
dark look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll include Ruddy,&rdquo; answered Reff
Ritter. &ldquo;I hate him, too. I&rsquo;d give most anything
if we could drive &rsquo;em both from the
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can&mdash;if we watch our chances,&rdquo;
answered Gus Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">WHAT THE WIND DID</span></h2>
<p>Pornell Academy was a rival institution of
learning, located several miles from Putnam Hall.
It was presided over by Doctor Pornell, who had
not fancied Captain Putnam&rsquo;s coming to that
locality. The students of Pornell were for the
most part sons of wealthy parents, and a large
number of them thought themselves superior to
the Putnam Hall cadets.</p>
<p>On one occasion the lads of the two institutions
had had quite a lively row, but this had
been patched up, and several contests on the lake
and on the athletic field had come off. Sometimes
the Putnam Hall cadets were defeated, but
more times they were victorious, which pleased
them not a little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Fred Century had come to Pornell Academy
several months before this story opens. He was
from Portland, Maine, and belonged to a boat
club that usually sailed its craft on Casco Bay.
Immediately on his arrival at Cayuga Lake he
took up boating and then had his father purchase
for him the <i>Ajax</i>, certainly a craft of which
any young man might well be proud. Then he
heard that Jack had a new boat, the <i>Alice</i>, and
he watched for his opportunity to race. That
opportunity had now presented itself; and the
race was on.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day, with the sun shining
brightly and the breeze strong enough to make
the sails of the sloops fill well. The Putnam
Hall cadets had left the school with no idea of a
contest of any sort, but now that the race was in
progress they were keenly interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about this Fred Century,&rdquo; remarked
Dale, as the <i>Alice</i> sped on her course.
&ldquo;They tell me his father is next door to being a
millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is certain&mdash;he has a good opinion
of his boat,&rdquo; added Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got a good opinion of my boat,
too,&rdquo; answered the young major. &ldquo;I want her
to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she must win!&rdquo; cried Stuffer. &ldquo;Why,
don&rsquo;t you know that those Pornell fellows are
just aching for a chance to crow over us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The race had now been noted by a number of
people out in pleasure boats. Many knew that
the two sloops were new boats and they were
curious to learn which might prove to be the
better. Some waved their hands and handkerchiefs,
and others shouted words of encouragement
to one group of lads or the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if the Pornell boat was going
to win,&rdquo; said one gentleman, who was out in
his pleasure yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa, how can you say that?&rdquo; cried his
daughter, who was an admirer of the Putnam
Hall cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because their boat is ahead,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>It was not long before Cat Point was reached.
The <i>Ajax</i> rounded the rocks in fine style, for
Fred Century was really a skillful skipper and
knew how to handle his craft to perfection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye to you!&rdquo; he called out, as his craft
stood for a moment close to the <i>Alice</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell everybody you&rsquo;re coming sooner or
later,&rdquo; added Bat Sedley. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too long&mdash;folks
may get tired of waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think they&rsquo;ll get tired of your blowing,&rdquo;
retorted Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get uppish!&rdquo; cried the Pornell Academy
boy, angrily, and then the two sloops passed out
of speaking distance of each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the wind would freshen,&rdquo; said Jack,
with something like a sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo; demanded Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it got too fresh it would make them take
in some sail. The <i>Alice</i> is broader than the <i>Ajax</i>,
consequently we can risk a little more than they
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think the breeze is freshening,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;Just look down the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did as directed and saw that he was
right, for the water was beginning to show numerous
whitecaps and ripples. The <i>Alice</i> rounded
Cat Point, the mainsail was thrown over, and
they started for Borden&rsquo;s Cove with the rival
sloop more than a quarter of a mile in the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we can catch up to that boat
even if the wind does freshen,&rdquo; remarked Dale,
soberly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got too much of a lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the breeze!&rdquo; shouted Pepper, and
he was right, the wind had freshened as if by
magic, and at once the sloop bounded forward
at an increased speed, cutting the water like a
thing of life and sending a shower of spray over
all those on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! I didn&rsquo;t come out for a shower-bath!&rdquo;
yelled Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to stand for it, though,&rdquo; answered Jack,
with a grin. &ldquo;All for the glory of the cause,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The breeze kept increasing, and this caused
the <i>Alice</i> to heel well over on her side. This
made Paul a little bit anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better take in some sail?&rdquo; he ventured.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be dumped into the
lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;It will have to
blow harder than this to send the <i>Alice</i> over.
There is a whole lot of lead in her keel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the increase in the wind the <i>Alice</i> kept
gaining slowly but surely on the <i>Ajax</i>, and this
gladdened the heart of the youthful owner. He
looked ahead and saw that Fred Century was
gazing back anxiously on the rival that was coming
nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he is wondering when we&rsquo;ll take in
some sail,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Well, he can keep on
wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is taking in his topsail!&rdquo; cried Pepper, a
moment later, and the announcement proved correct.
In the meantime the wind came stronger
than ever, until it fairly whistled through the
ropes aboard the <i>Alice</i>. Under ordinary circumstances
Jack would have lowered not only his
topsail but also his mainsail&mdash;or at least taken a
reef in the latter&mdash;but now he was determined
to win the race if taking a small risk would do
it. By this time the other boats on the lake were
making for various harbors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>But if Jack was willing to take a risk, so was
Fred Century, and against the wishes of his two
companions the lad from Pornell Academy kept
all his sails flying. As a consequence the <i>Ajax</i>
suddenly careened and took aboard enough water
to literally wash the deck and flood the standing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, look out, or we&rsquo;ll all be drowned!&rdquo; yelled
Will Carey. He was not much of a sailor or a
swimmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t mind a dip like that,&rdquo; said
Fred Century, reassuringly, yet even as he spoke
he looked anxiously at the sky and at the wind-clouds
scurrying past. He knew that if the wind
increased much more he would have to take in
his topsail and his mainsail and perhaps his jib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That other sloop is coming up fast,&rdquo; announced
Bat Sedley, not a great while later.
And he spoke the truth, the <i>Alice</i> was approaching
by what looked to be leaps and bounds, making
the best possible use of the stiffening breeze
as Jack hung to the tiller and eased her off, this
way or that. The young major had issued orders
to his chums, and they stood ready to lower both
mainsail and topsail at the word of command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The <i>Alice</i> was still a good half-mile from
Borden&rsquo;s Cove when her bow overlapped the
stern of the <i>Ajax</i>. At this Pepper set up a yell
of pleasure and all with him joined in. They
waved their hands to those on the other craft,
but received no answer. Then they forged ahead,
the ever-increasing wind driving them along
faster and faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower the topsail as soon as we are far
enough ahead,&rdquo; ordered Jack. &ldquo;No use of running
the risk of breaking our mast now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange whistling of the wind followed, and
down came the topsail in a jiffy. Then several
reefs were taken in the mainsail. The bosom of
the lake was now a mass of whitecaps, while the
sun went under a heavy cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wind squall, and a corker!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they take in some sail on the
<i>Ajax</i>?&rdquo; asked Dale, as he clung to a guard rail,
to keep from being swept overboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are taking in the topsail,&rdquo; announced
Jack. &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t enough. If they
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of his words was lost in the piping
of the gale that came extra strong just then.
The sloop seemed to be fairly lifted from the
lake, then she sank into a hollow and the water
dashed over her stern. Then she bobbed up like
a cork and shot forward as before. Pepper,
holding tight with might and main, glanced back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Ajax</i> has gone over!&rdquo; he screamed, in
alarm.</p>
<p>Only Jack understood his words, but the others
saw the look in his face and saw him nod to a
spot behind them on the bosom of the angry
lake. True enough, carrying the mainsail had
proved too much for the Pornell craft, and she
was now drifting along on her side, her mast
half-submerged in the lashing and foaming
waves.</p>
<p>The Putnam Hall cadets were greatly alarmed,
and with good reason. They had no desire to
see any of their rivals drowned, and they felt it
was more than likely one or another had gone
overboard. Indeed, as they looked back, they
saw one youth struggling in the water near the
toppled-over mast, while another was trailing behind,
clutching some broken cordage. The third
lad was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; yelled Paul, to make himself
heard above the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to bring the sloop around,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;Stand ready to throw them some ropes
and those life-preservers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>As well as the squall would permit, the young
major sent the <i>Alice</i> around. Even with only the
jib set this was a dangerous operation, and he
would not have undertaken it had he not thought
it a case of life or death. As the sloop came
broadside to the squall a wave struck her and
broke over the deck. The full force of this landed
on Pepper, carrying him off his feet in a
twinkling. As he slid around Paul made a clutch
for him and held fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goo&mdash;good for you, Stuffer!&rdquo; gasped Pepper,
when he could speak. &ldquo;Say, but that was
something awful!&rdquo; And he took a better hold
than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid some of those fellows will go
down before we can reach them,&rdquo; answered
Paul. &ldquo;My, what a blow this is! And it looked
to be a perfect afternoon when we started out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sloop boasted of two life-preservers, with
lines attached, and as well as they were able the
cadets got these in readiness for use. In the
meanwhile Jack, having brought the craft up in
the wind, was now &ldquo;jockeying&rdquo; to get close to
the overturned craft without crashing into the
wreck or running anybody down. This was a
delicate task, and would have been practically
impossible had not the breeze just then died down
a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save us! Save us!&rdquo; came from the water,
as the <i>Alice</i> drew closer.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic1">
<img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="&ldquo;SAVE US!&rdquo; CAME FROM THE WATER, AS THE ALICE DREW CLOSER." width="500" height="776" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;SAVE US!&rdquo; CAME FROM THE WATER, AS THE ALICE DREW CLOSER.</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; yelled back the boys from Putnam
Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, catch the life-preserver!&rdquo; called out
Paul, and flung the preserver in question toward
Bat Sedley, who was floundering around near the
half-submerged mast. The Pornell Academy lad
saw it coming and made a dive for it, catching
it with one hand. Pepper threw the second life-preserver
to Fred Century, who was trying to
pull himself toward his wrecked craft by some
loose ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the third boy?&rdquo; was asked, but for
the moment nobody could answer that question.
Bat Sedley had seen him hanging fast to some
ropes as the <i>Ajax</i> went over, but had not seen
him since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have gone down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Pepper,
when Jack set up a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is, under the edge of that sail,&rdquo; and
he pointed to where the broad mainsail of the
<i>Ajax</i> rose and fell on the waves. True enough,
Will Carey was there, one arm and one leg
caught fast in the sheeting and some ropes. He
had been struggling, but now he fell back and
went under, out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got to save him!&rdquo; cried Jack.
&ldquo;Here, Pepper, take the tiller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go overboard after him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>As he spoke the youthful owner of the <i>Alice</i>
pulled off his cadet coat and cap. The next instant
he was at the side of the sloop. He poised
himself for a dive, and then cut the water like a
knife and disappeared from view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">ABOUT A GYMNASTIC CONTEST</span></h2>
<p>Major Jack Ruddy was a good swimmer,
and felt perfectly at home in the water. He did
not go down deep, but he made a long &ldquo;fetch,&rdquo;
and when he came up he was close beside Will
Carey. He caught that youth by the arm and
dragged him clear of the sail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sa&mdash;save m&mdash;me!&rdquo; sputtered the Pornell
Academy youth, after blowing some water from
his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;But keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&mdash;my foot is&mdash;is fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A piece of rope had become entwined around
Will Carey&rsquo;s ankle. It was caught in a loop and
it was no easy thing to loosen it. The Pornell
Academy lad thrashed around wildly and tried
to get Jack by the throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; cried the young major.
&ldquo;Hold on easy-like.&rdquo; But like many others in
danger of drowning Will Carey now grew frantic,
and scarcely realizing his actions he caught
Jack by the neck and clung so fast that the
young major was in danger of being choked to
death.</p>
<p>The wind had now veered around, sending the
<i>Alice</i> some distance away from the <i>Ajax</i>, so that
Pepper and the others could offer no assistance.
Such being the case, and realizing the seriousness
of his position, Jack did what appeared to be
cruel, but was fully justified. As well as he
could he hauled back with his fist and struck the
other boy in the chin. It was a stiff, hard blow
and it dazed Will Carey and rendered him all
but insensible. At once his hold on Jack relaxed,
and he lay like a log in the young major&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>With his free hand Jack worked with all possible
haste on the rope which held the other boy
a prisoner and soon managed to loosen the loop
and slip Will&rsquo;s foot through it. Then, with the
Pornell Academy lad on his shoulder, he swam
away from the capsized sloop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack! Jack!&rdquo; came the call above the wind,
and turning slightly he saw the <i>Alice</i> coming toward
him. A line with one of the life-preservers
attached was flung to him and he grasped it.
Then he was hauled up to the stern of the sloop
and finally dragged on board, with Will still in
his grasp. The sufferer was just opening his
eyes again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&mdash;don&rsquo;t hi&mdash;hit me ag&mdash;again!&rdquo; he
gasped. &ldquo;Please do&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right now,&rdquo; answered Jack. He
was so exhausted he could scarcely speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Will Carey, and that was all he
said for several minutes. Jack placed him on a
seat and sank down beside him. All of the
other lads but Pepper, who was at the tiller, surrounded
the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a brave thing to do, Jack,&rdquo; was Dale&rsquo;s
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you hit him for?&rdquo; demanded Bat
Sedley, who had seen the blow from a distance.
&ldquo;It was a mean thing to do when he was struggling
for his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to do it&mdash;he had me by the throat. If
I had not done it both of us might have been
drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I never heard of hitting a drowning
person,&rdquo; sneered Bat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of such a thing,&rdquo; put in Fred
Century. &ldquo;I think you deserve a good deal of
credit for what you did,&rdquo; he added, with a warm
look at the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he could have saved Will without
trying to break his jaw,&rdquo; grumbled Bat Sedley,
and then turned his attention to the youth Jack
had rescued. Clearly he was not one to give his
rival any credit.</p>
<p>By this time the squall&mdash;for it was little else&mdash;was
going down. The whitecaps still ruffled
the bosom of Cayuga Lake, but the wind had
dwindled to a gentle breeze, just enough to fill
the sails of the <i>Alice</i> and no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Jack?&rdquo; questioned Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel a little better
with a dry uniform on, but that can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d feel better myself with dry clothing,&rdquo;
came from Fred Century, with a weak
smile. He gazed anxiously at his capsized craft.
&ldquo;I must say, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with my
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly can&rsquo;t right her out here,&rdquo; said
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we can do is to tow her in as she is,&rdquo;
continued Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that willingly; eh,
fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; came the prompt answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll do that I&rsquo;ll be much obliged. Our
race didn&rsquo;t turn out just as I anticipated,&rdquo; went
on Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;You kept your sails up too long,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that&mdash;now. But I thought the <i>Ajax</i>
would stand the blow until I reached the Cove.
How are you, Will?&rdquo; he continued, turning to
the boy who had come so close to drowning.</p>
<p>Will Carey had little to say. He mumbled in
a low tone and looked rather darkly at Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is angry because you hit him,&rdquo; whispered
Paul to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it if he is, Stuffer,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;I simply had to do something or go
down with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, and he ought to be thankful he
was saved. But some fellows don&rsquo;t know what
gratitude is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not without considerable difficulty a line was
made fast to the bow of the capsized sloop and
the task of towing the <i>Ajax</i> was begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had time I think we could right that
craft,&rdquo; observed Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; demanded Bat Sedley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By taking her over to yonder point, where
the tall trees overhang the water. We could run
a rope up over a tall tree limb and then fasten
it to the mast of the <i>Ajax</i>. By pulling on the
end of the rope I think we&rsquo;d bring her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and sink her, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we watched out and kept bailing as she
righted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try that,&rdquo; said Fred Century. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ll take us over to the point and lend us some
ropes I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he added, after turning the project
over in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;ll take you over,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll help all we can. But we&rsquo;ve got to get
back to Putnam Hall by six o&rsquo;clock, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; ejaculated Will Carey, leaping to his
feet with great suddenness. &ldquo;Did anybody see
my box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Box? What box?&rdquo; asked several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little blue, tin box I was carrying in my
coat-pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I haven&rsquo;t seen any blue box,&rdquo; answered
Pepper, and looked around the standing-room
of the <i>Alice</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you have in it, Will?&rdquo; asked Fred
Century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;oh, not much, but I didn&rsquo;t
want to lose the box, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; stammered the
youth who had come close to drowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have it in your pocket when you
went overboard?&rdquo; questioned the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I had my hand on it, too,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s at the bottom of the lake
now,&rdquo; added Will Carey. His face showed a
look of positive worry. &ldquo;How deep is it where
the <i>Ajax</i> went over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be ten or twelve feet at least,&rdquo; answered
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think you might go fishing for it?&rdquo;
questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but not now.&rdquo; And that was all Will
Carey said about the blue, tin box. But that he
was very much worried was plainly evident. And
he had good cause to worry, as we shall learn
later.</p>
<p>The point of land mentioned having been
gained, the <i>Ajax</i> was towed around as Fred Century
desired, and then the young owner was
loaned a number of ropes and a pail for bailing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t right her I&rsquo;ll tie her fast and send
some boat builder after her,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I
am much obliged for what you&rsquo;ve done. Some
day I&rsquo;ll race you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still think the <i>Ajax</i> a better boat than the
<i>Alice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly isn&rsquo;t a bad boat,&rdquo; put in Pepper.
&ldquo;A real race to a finish will have to decide
which is the better of the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll beat you out of your boots,&rdquo; said
Bat Sedley. Will Carey said nothing. He was
still thinking about the loss of his blue, tin box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>As it was getting late, the Putnam Hall cadets
lost no time in steering as straight a course as
possible for the school dock. But the breeze was
against them, so they were not able to reach the
dock until nearly half-past six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fortunate old Crabtree is away on business,&rdquo;
was Pepper&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be sure
to haul us over the coals for being late, even if
we did meet with an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late again, eh?&rdquo; cried a voice from the boathouse,
and Peleg Snuggers, the general utility
man around the Hall, stepped into view. &ldquo;The
captain don&rsquo;t allow sech doin&rsquo;s, and you young
gents know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be helped, Peleg,&rdquo; answered Pepper.
&ldquo;Blew so hard the wind turned our sails
inside out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me?&rdquo; The hired man looked
perplexed for a moment. &ldquo;Inside out? How
could that be? I reckon you&rsquo;re joking. Oh, Major
Jack, you&rsquo;re all wet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted a swim and was too lazy to take
off his clothes,&rdquo; put in Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The uniform will be ruined. Better take it
off now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack wants to go to bed in it,&rdquo; said Pepper,
lightly. He loved to tease Peleg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! you must have your joke. I
reckon he won&rsquo;t go to bed in no wet clothes, &rsquo;less
he wants to git rheumatism an&rsquo; lumbago, an&rsquo; a
few other things,&rdquo; answered Peleg Snuggers, and
walked away.</p>
<p>Without loss of time Jack slipped up to his
dormitory and changed his wet uniform for a dry
suit. Then the wet clothing was sent to the
laundry to be dried and pressed. In the meantime
the other lads hastened to the mess-room
for supper. There they told Captain Putnam of
what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be more careful in the future,&rdquo;
said the master of the school. &ldquo;A squall is a
nasty thing to be out in&mdash;I know that from personal
experience. I must see Major Ruddy and
have a talk with him,&rdquo; and he hastened off to
Jack&rsquo;s room. He could not help but praise the
young major for his heroism.</p>
<p>It soon became noised about the Hall that the
new sloop from Pornell Academy had met Jack&rsquo;s
craft, and more of the cadets were interested in
the outcome of the race than they were in the
rescue that had taken place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was a great thing to pull those
chaps out of the water,&rdquo; was Andy Snow&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;But I do wish you had beaten them by
about a mile, Pep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when the squall came we simply had to
call it off&mdash;with the other sloop capsized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Andy,&rdquo; went on Pepper. &ldquo;I
understand that you have a little contest of your
own coming off at the gym.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have,&rdquo; answered the acrobatic youth of
Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you going to meet this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gus Coulter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, that bully! I thought you were done
with Coulter, Ritter, and that crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;But Coulter
said I was afraid to meet him in a hand-walking
and chinning-the-bar contest, and bragged to all
the others what he could do, so I had to take him
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he so good at lifting his own weight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Henry Lee told me he saw
him chinning the bar nine times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you can do better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can. But we are to do some walking
on our hands first,&rdquo; went on Andy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather do some stunts on the bars and rings&mdash;it is
more in my line,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I wish he would
challenge me to do the giant&rsquo;s swing against him&mdash;then
I&rsquo;d feel sure I could beat him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">SHORTCAKE AND LEMONADE</span></h2>
<p>It was a jolly crowd that gathered that evening
in the dormitory occupied by Jack, Pepper,
and their chums. Besides Dale and Stuffer there
were Andy, big Bart Conners, the captain of
Company B, Joe Nelson, Henry Lee, and Joseph
Hogan, an Irish youth who was the soul of good
humor and wit.</p>
<p>Of course Jack and the others had to tell every
detail of the adventure on the lake and tell all
they could about the Pornell Academy sloop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did those chaps say anything about Roy
Bock?&rdquo; asked Andy. He referred to a student
of Pornell who had on several occasions caused
our friends considerable trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they are not friends of Bock and his
crowd?&rdquo; put in Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carey and Sedley are that,&rdquo; answered Hogan.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see them all at Cedarville a couple of
Sunday nights ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;On Sunday?&rdquo; queried Jack. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
they were allowed out on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you come to be out, Emerald?&rdquo;
questioned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to see me uncle, who was sthoppin&rsquo; at
the hotel till Monday marnin&rsquo;. Coming home I
passed that new tavern on the shore road. I met
Roy Bock comin&rsquo; out, and he had Sedley, Carey,
and four or five others wid him. They was all
smokin&rsquo; and cuttin&rsquo; up in a lively fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Doctor Pornell approves of
that,&rdquo; came from Joe Nelson. He himself rarely
did anything against the rules and was a good
deal of a model for the other boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that new tavern is a very good
place, either,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Last week they arrested
three men there, for getting into a quarrel
over a game of cards. They said the men were
drinking heavily and gambling. That kind of a
resort is no place for any students to visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy Bock is sore on us,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;Every time I meet him he glares at me
as if he&rsquo;d like to chew me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he is down on us,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because Pepper is sweet on those Ford
girls,&rdquo; said Bart Conners. &ldquo;Say, Imp, which are
you going to choose when you grow up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pep has got to stand aside for Jack and
Andy,&rdquo; put in Dale. &ldquo;Ever since&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, change the subject!&rdquo; cried Andy, growing
red in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; added Pepper. &ldquo;By the
way,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Somebody said there was
to be a surprise to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly&mdash;at ten-thirty,&rdquo; answered Henry
Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; questioned several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must know, my cousin from
Boston was in town to-day, and just for the fun
of it he had the Cedarville baker make two big
strawberry shortcakes for me. He told me to
treat my friends. The baker is to leave them in
a box at the apple-tree on the corner of the
campus. He had a party to cater to, and he said
he would leave the cakes at just ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the shortberry strawcakes!&rdquo; cried
Pepper. &ldquo;Hen, your cousin is a fellow after my
own heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to keep it a little quiet,&rdquo; continued
Henry Lee. &ldquo;For I didn&rsquo;t want to invite too
many to the spread. I don&rsquo;t really know how big
the cakes will be&mdash;although I know my cousin
Dick doesn&rsquo;t do things by halves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is half-past nine now,&rdquo; said Jack, consulting
the time-piece he carried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like one of you to go out with me, after
the cakes,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Each may be in a
separate box, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All volunteered at once, for all loved strawberry
shortcake. At last it was decided that Pepper
should go with Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with making some lemonade
to go with the cake?&rdquo; ventured Andy. &ldquo;I
know there is a basket of lemons in the storeroom
downstairs, and there is plenty of sugar
there, too&mdash;and water costs nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan met with instant approval, and Andy
and Dale were appointed a committee of two to
provide the lemonade. By this time the monitor
was coming around, and they had to put out
lights. The Hall became very quiet, for all the
cadets were supposed to be in bed.</p>
<p>The four boys slipped downstairs by a back
way, and while Andy and Dale tiptoed to the
store-room, Pepper and Henry slipped out of a
side-door. Once outside, the latter put on their
shoes, which they had carried in their hands, and
hurried across the broad campus in the direction
of the apple-tree where the baker was to leave
the cakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;If not, I suppose all we can do is to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>When they got to the tree no boxes were there,
and they sat down on a small grassy bank to
wait. Beside the bank grew a clump of bushes,
which screened them from the Hall. It was a
fairly clear night, with bright stars shining in
the heavens overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That baker is certainly late,&rdquo; mused Henry,
after a good ten minutes had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting hungry?&rdquo; asked Pepper, good-naturedly.
&ldquo;He may have been delayed on account
of the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t forget about the cakes.
Perhaps&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cadets became silent, as they heard a
door close rather sharply. Looking through the
clump of bushes, they saw two figures stealing
from the school building towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the other fellows are coming,&rdquo; cried
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should they bother, Pep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. But I think&mdash;Well,
I never! It is Gus Coulter and Reff Ritter!
What can they be doing out here to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get out of sight and find out,&rdquo; answered
Henry, and dragged his chum to a clump
of bushes still farther back from the campus.
He had hardly done this when Gus Coulter and
Reff Ritter came up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody here yet?&rdquo; asked Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anybody,&rdquo; answered Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough! I was afraid they&rsquo;d get here
before us. Where do you suppose the baker put
the cakes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumps heard Lee say under this apple-tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the two cadets became silent as they
moved around in the vicinity of the apple-tree.
In the meantime Pepper pinched Henry&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are after your strawberry shortcakes,&rdquo;
he whispered. &ldquo;What a nerve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Mumps, the sneak, told them,&rdquo; murmured
Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell Mumps you were to have the
cakes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Mumps? Not much! I have no use for
that sneak! I suppose he must have been listening
at the door of your dormitory&mdash;it&rsquo;s just like
him. If I ever get the chance, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! They are coming this way!&rdquo; interrupted
Pepper. &ldquo;Crouch low, or they&rsquo;ll see us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cadets got down in the deepest
shadows they could find. Coulter and Ritter
came quite close, but did not discover the pair.
The two bullies looked up and down the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;That baker must have left the cakes and they
must have got &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;Mumps
didn&rsquo;t tell us soon enough. Too bad! I thought
sure we&rsquo;d be able to spoil their little feast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can spoil it yet,&rdquo; answered Reff
Ritter. &ldquo;Let us go in again and see what can
be done,&rdquo; and then he and his crony moved once
again toward Putnam Hall and were lost to sight
in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows what sort of fellows Coulter and
Ritter are,&rdquo; said Pepper, when they were gone.
&ldquo;And it shows what a sneak Mumps is, too.&rdquo;
As my old readers know, he, of course, referred
to John Fenwick, who had, on more than one
occasion, proved himself to be a sneak of the
first water. Fenwick was a great toady to Dan
Baxter, but during that individual&rsquo;s absence from
the Hall had attached himself to Coulter and Ritter,
and was willing to do almost anything to
curry favor with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certainly mighty glad they didn&rsquo;t get
the cakes,&rdquo; was Henry&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
they have had the laugh on us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have the laugh on us, anyway, if we
don&rsquo;t get the cakes. But I think I hear a wagon
coming now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Pepper was right&mdash;a wagon was coming along
the main road at a good rate of speed. It was
the baker&rsquo;s turnout, and soon he came to a halt
near the apple-tree and leaped out with two flat
pasteboard boxes in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I am late, but that party delayed me,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;There you are&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll find them
the best strawberry shortcakes you ever ate.&rdquo;
And having delivered the delicacies he hopped
into his wagon again and drove off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got the goods, anyway,&rdquo; said
Pepper, with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Now to get back
into the Hall without being discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us send the cakes up by way of the window,&rdquo;
suggested Henry. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to be
caught with them in our possession&mdash;if Coulter
and Ritter have squealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys ran across the campus, stooping at
the roadway to pick up some pebbles. These
they threw up to the window of one of the
dormitories. It was a well-known signal, and
the sash was immediately raised and Jack&rsquo;s head
appeared, followed by the head of Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower a line and haul up these two boxes,&rdquo;
answered Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter and Ritter are onto our game,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;Mumps gave us away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>No more was said just then. A strong fishing
line was let down from above, and one pasteboard
box after another was raised up. Then
the two cadets on the campus ran around to the
side door of the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I suspected, they locked it,&rdquo; said Pepper,
rather bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to get in somehow. Wonder
if they can&rsquo;t let down a rope of some kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might let down the rope in the bath-room,&rdquo;
answered Pepper. He referred to a
rope which was tied to a ring in the bath-room
floor. This had been placed there in case of fire,
even though the school was provided with regular
fire escapes.</p>
<p>Once more they summoned Jack and the
others, and Jack ran to the bath-room and let the
rope down. Then those below came up hand
over hand, bracing their feet against the wall of
the building as they did so.</p>
<p>As the boys came from the bath-room they
heard light footsteps on the back stairs. Andy
and Dale were coming up, each with a big pitcher
of lemonade. Both were snickering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does the fun come in?&rdquo; asked Jack,
as all hurried to his dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A joke on Coulter and Ritter,&rdquo; cried Andy,
merrily. &ldquo;We caught them nosing around downstairs
and I called them into the store-room in
the dark. Then I slipped past them and locked
them in. They can&rsquo;t get out excepting by the
window, and then they&rsquo;ll have to get back into
the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;It serves &rsquo;em right,&rdquo; answered Pepper, and
then told of what had been heard by himself and
Henry down by the apple-tree. &ldquo;We ought to
pay Mumps back for spying on us, too,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>It was voted to dispose of the strawberry shortcake
and the lemonade at once. The cakes were
cut up and passed around, and voted &ldquo;the best
ever.&rdquo; The lemonade was also good, and the
cadets drank their fill of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with the two
pitchers?&rdquo; asked Joe Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; I have an idea, so I have,&rdquo; came
from Emerald. &ldquo;Phy not leave &rsquo;em in Mumps&rsquo;s
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll
leave this chunk of ice, too,&rdquo; and he rattled the
piece in the pitcher as he spoke.</p>
<p>Taking the two pitchers, the Irish student and
Pepper approached the dormitory in which John
Fenwick slept, along with Ritter, Coulter, Nick
Paxton and Dan Baxter. They found the door
unlocked and pushed it open. To their astonishment
they met Mumps face to face. He was
waiting for the return of Ritter and Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what do you want?&rdquo; he began, but got
no further, for without ceremony both boys thrust
the empty pitchers into his arms. Then Pepper
rammed the piece of ice down Mumps&rsquo;s neck, and
he and Emerald ran off swiftly and silently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE INTERVIEW IN THE OFFICE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you&mdash;er&mdash;you let me alone!&rdquo; sputtered
Mumps. &ldquo;Oh, my back! What did you want to
put ice down my back for? Oh, dear, I&rsquo;ll be all
froze up!&rdquo; And he danced around and let the
two pitchers fall to the floor with a crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time we paid him back for his
sneaking tricks,&rdquo; whispered Pepper, as he sped
for his dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, he&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; noise enough to wake the
dead, so he is!&rdquo; was Hogan&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;If that
don&rsquo;t wake Captain Putnam up he must be slapin&rsquo;
wid cotton in his ears an&rsquo; ear mufflers on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing we can do is to get in bed and
lose no time about it,&rdquo; answered the Imp, and
began to undress before his bedroom was gained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The others were speedily acquainted with the
turn of affairs, and in less than three minutes
every cadet was undressed and in bed. The
pasteboard boxes had been thrown out of a window
and all the crumbs of the little feast swept
up.</p>
<p>Hogan was right, the noise soon awakened
Captain Putnam, and the master of the Hall
arose, donned a dressing gown, and sallied forth
to see what was the matter. Then from an upper
bed-chamber Mrs. Green, the matron of the
school, appeared. She was a good-natured
woman, but any alarm at night scared her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, Captain Putnam?&rdquo; she
asked, in a trembling voice. &ldquo;Have burglars
gotten into the school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they have they are making a big noise about
it,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam. &ldquo;I rather think
some of the cadets are up to pranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the school is on fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the school on fire?&rdquo; demanded a student,
who just then stuck his head out of a dormitory
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the school is on fire I&rsquo;m going to get out!&rdquo;
exclaimed another cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! There is no fire!&rdquo; cried the master
of the Hall, hastily. &ldquo;I believe it is nothing but
some boys cutting-up. Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound in Mumps&rsquo;s dormitory had ceased,
but now came another sound from downstairs&mdash;the
overturning of a chair, followed by the crash
of glassware.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is in the dining-room, or the store-room!&rdquo;
shrieked Mrs. Green. &ldquo;Oh, they must
be burglars, sir! The boys would not make such
a dreadful noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon get at the bottom of this,&rdquo; said Captain
Putnam, sternly, and ran down the back
stairs as rapidly as his dressing gown would permit.
In the meantime many boys came out into
the corridors, and George Strong, the assistant
teacher, appeared.</p>
<p>When Captain Putnam reached the store-room
he found the door locked. But the key
was in the lock, and he speedily turned it and let
himself in. It was almost totally dark in the
room, and he had not taken two steps before he
felt some broken glass under his feet. The window
was open and he darted to it, to behold two
students on the campus outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he called out. But instead of obeying
the command the students kept on running, and
disappeared from sight around an angle of the
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will get at the bottom of this&mdash;I must get at
the bottom of it,&rdquo; the master of the Hall told
himself, and lost no time in lighting up. A glance
around showed him that a small stand containing
some water-glasses had been tipped over and
several glasses were broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;That stand was in the way in the dining-room,
so we had it removed to here,&rdquo; explained
Mrs. Green. &ldquo;Oh, what a mess! Be careful,
sir, or you&rsquo;ll cut your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Strong, two students just leaped from
this window and are outside,&rdquo; said the captain,
as his assistant appeared at the store-room door.
&ldquo;Find out who they are and bring them to my
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered George Strong, and ran
for a door opening onto the campus. Once outside
he saw Coulter and Ritter in the act of
sneaking off towards the barns and ran after
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do you no good to run away,&rdquo; he cried,
as he came up and caught each by the arm. &ldquo;Ah,
so it is you, Coulter, and you, Ritter. You will
report at once at Captain Putnam&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t doing anything,&rdquo; growled Gus
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell the captain your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meekly Ritter and Coulter marched into the
Hall and to the office. They knew not what to
say. They had not dreamed of being locked in
the store-room, and the table with the glassware
had been knocked over by Ritter in an endeavor
to get the window open in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young men, what have you to say for
yourselves?&rdquo; demanded Captain Putnam, sternly,
as he confronted the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We broke the glassware by mistake, sir,&rdquo; answered
Reff Ritter. &ldquo;I will pay for the damage
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what were you doing in the store-room
at this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;er&mdash;we came down to get&mdash;er&mdash;to get
some lemons,&rdquo; faltered Coulter. &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I had
a pain in the stomach, and I thought sucking on
a lemon would cure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Did you have a pain, too?&rdquo; and the
master of the Hall turned to Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, but&mdash;er&mdash;Gus was so sick I thought
I had best come down with him,&rdquo; answered Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you still sick, Coulter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;the pain seems better now, sir. I
guess I scared it away!&rdquo; And the guilty cadet
smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Well, why did you leave the store-room
by way of the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because while we were inside somebody came
and locked the door on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Some other students, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. It was too dark for us to see who
they were.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you went down for nothing but lemons,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you go straight to bed, and after this,
if you want any lemons you call one of the servants
or teachers; do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait just a moment. What was that noise
upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the neighborhood of your dormitory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was made by the boys who locked
us in,&rdquo; was Reff Ritter&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, go to bed. If I hear any more
noise, or learn of any more prowling around in
the dark, I&rsquo;ll make an example of somebody,&rdquo;
added Captain Putnam, and with that the two
cadets were dismissed, and they lost no time in
making for their dormitory. There they learned
from Mumps how the sneak had been treated by
Pepper and Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That chunk of ice was as cold as&mdash;as Greenland!&rdquo;
said the sneak, dismally. &ldquo;It melted
right on my backbone, so how could I help but
make a noise. There are the two pitchers. I
wish I could fire them at somebody&rsquo;s head!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Put them out in the hall&mdash;away from our
door,&rdquo; ordered Ritter. &ldquo;If they are found here
they will make more trouble&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve had
enough for one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Ruddy&rsquo;s crowd put this up our back,&rdquo;
was Coulter&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Oh, how I wish I
could get square with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I didn&rsquo;t go downstairs,&rdquo; came from
Nick Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t get hold of the strawberry
shortcakes at all,&rdquo; said Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and we don&rsquo;t know if they got &rsquo;em,
either,&rdquo; answered Coulter. &ldquo;Maybe you were
mistaken, Mumpsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we made a fizzle of getting the cakes
anyway,&rdquo; growled Ritter. &ldquo;I am going to bed,&rdquo;
and in a thoroughly bad humor he turned in, and
his cronies followed his example.</p>
<p>The joke on Coulter, Ritter, and Mumps could
not be kept, and by the next day many students
were laughing at the two bullies and the sneak.
This made the three very angry, but they did not
dare to say anything in public, for fear of getting
into trouble with Captain Putnam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The contest between Coulter and Andy Snow
was to come off in the gymnasium that afternoon
after school and, as a consequence, quite a number
of students assembled to witness what was
to take place. A large number thought Andy
would win out, yet Gus Coulter had quite a few
supporters, for he was known to be not only
large but strong.</p>
<p>When Andy came in Coulter had not yet arrived.
At once Andy began to practice. As soon
as he did this Nick Paxton came up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to swing against me?&rdquo; demanded
Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have a contest with Coulter to-day,&rdquo;
answered Andy shortly. He had no use for Paxton,
and was not above letting the latter know
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid, eh?&rdquo; sneered the other cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not afraid of you, Paxton, and you
know it,&rdquo; answered Andy, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are afraid,&rdquo; growled the other boy,
and moved off. In a minute, however, he came
back, and seizing hold of a long rope suspended
from the gymnasium ceiling, commenced to
swing upon it.</p>
<p>Jack and Pepper came in, and they stood talking
to Andy as Paxton continued to swing back
and forth, close at hand. Then Paxton changed
his course, so that his feet struck Jack on the
arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that, Paxton!&rdquo; cried the young major,
but before he could say more the cadet on the
rope launched himself forward again, with feet
extended, and caught Andy in the left wrist. The
blow was so strong that the acrobatic youth was
bowled over on the polished floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch, my wrist!&rdquo; cried Andy, as he scrambled
up. Then he gazed sharply at Paxton. &ldquo;What
did you do that for?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I didn&rsquo;t mean to touch you,&rdquo; was
the short answer, and Paxton dropped from the
rope and started for the other end of the gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and ran after
Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Pep Ditmore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You struck Andy on purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say you did! It was a mean thing
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you make me tired,&rdquo; grunted Nick Paxton,
but his tone betrayed his uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you struck Andy so as to injure
him,&rdquo; said Jack. To this Paxton made no answer.
Instead he moved on, and soon lost himself
in a crowd of boys in another part of the
gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, does your wrist hurt much?&rdquo; questioned
Pepper, turning to his acrobatic chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;See, he
scraped part of the skin off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be hammered for it,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s
emphatic declaration.</p>
<p>Andy walked over to a sink and there allowed
the water to run over his wrist. Soon there was
a small swelling, which pained considerably.
Jack helped to tie a handkerchief around the
bruised member.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Snow, are you ready for the contest?&rdquo;
demanded Gus Coulter, walking up. He had just
passed Nick Paxton, and the latter had winked
at him suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy has been hurt,&rdquo; explained Jack. &ldquo;Paxton
kicked him in the wrist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Is this a trick to get out of meeting
me?&rdquo; grumbled Gus Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is no trick!&rdquo; exclaimed Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, you can&rsquo;t meet him with your wrist in
such bad shape,&rdquo; expostulated Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Postpone it until to-morrow,&rdquo; suggested Dale,
who was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is to meet me at all it must be to-day,&rdquo;
said Coulter, flatly. &ldquo;That bruise doesn&rsquo;t amount
to a hill of beans. I&rsquo;ve got a hurt myself,&rdquo; and
he showed the back of his left hand, which had
been slightly scratched by a playful kitten several
days before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is nothing to Andy&rsquo;s bruise,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;See, his wrist is quite swelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll meet him, anyway&mdash;and beat
him, too,&rdquo; declared Andy. &ldquo;Come on&mdash;I am
ready if you are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">ANDY SNOW&rsquo;S VICTORY</span></h2>
<p>The crowd surrounding Andy were both
pleased and astonished by his show of grit. It
was easy to see that his wrist was in bad shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, you can&rsquo;t do it to-day,&rdquo; pleaded Pepper.
&ldquo;Make him meet you some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to-day or never,&rdquo; said Gus Coulter,
bluntly.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the necessary space was
cleared and the contest commenced. It had been
agreed that the trial was to consist of the following:
Each boy was to walk the length of the
gymnasium on his hands and then rise up and
&ldquo;chin the bar,&rdquo; that is, draw himself up to his
chin on a turning bar. The contestant to &ldquo;chin
the bar&rdquo; the greatest number of times was to be
the winner.</p>
<p>Harry Blossom had been chosen umpire of the
contest, and at a word of command from him
the two students fell upon their hands and started
across the floor. At once Nick Paxton and Reff
Ritter began to crowd Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;You keep back there!&rdquo; cried Jack, and shoved
Paxton out of the way. Then he and Pepper
elbowed their way to Reff Ritter. &ldquo;Give Andy
a show,&rdquo; both said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother me,&rdquo; growled Ritter, giving
Jack a black look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get out of Andy&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; answered the
young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;keep the course clear, or I&rsquo;ll
call the contest off,&rdquo; called out Harry Blossom,
and Ritter and Paxton had to fall back. Mumps
was also present and wanted to hinder Andy, but
he had not the courage to do anything.</p>
<p>Andy&rsquo;s wrist pained him greatly, and long before
he reached the end of the gymnasium he felt
like giving up the contest. But he kept on, and
finished walking on his hands as quickly as did
Coulter. Then he pulled himself up on one bar
while his opponent did the same on another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three for Andy Snow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four for Gus Coulter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four for Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five for Gus! Stick to it, Gus, and you&rsquo;ll
win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy should not have tried it with that sore
wrist!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Amid encouraging cries and various criticisms,
the &ldquo;chinning&rdquo; went on until Gus Coulter had
pulled himself up twelve times. Andy had gone
up ten times. Gus was trying his best to get up
the thirteenth time, but seemed unable to make it.</p>
<p>Andy&rsquo;s wrist felt as if it was on fire, and he
had to grit his teeth to keep from crying out with
pain. But he clung to the bar and slowly but
surely went up the eleventh time, and then the
twelfth. Then he went up the thirteenth&mdash;just
as Coulter did likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tie!&rdquo; was the cry.</p>
<p>Again the two boys tried to rise. But Gus
Coulter&rsquo;s total strength was gone, and all he could
do was to raise himself a few inches. He hung
from the bar and glared at Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to call it a tie?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered Andy, shortly, and then went
up again. Gus could do no more, and he dropped
to the floor. Then with a quick movement Andy
raised himself up once again, and again, and then
a third time&mdash;and then let go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Andy Snow wins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went up seventeen times to Coulter&rsquo;s thirteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you, Andy Snow is a wonder! And
he did it with that hurt wrist, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>So the cries ran on, while Gus Coulter sneaked
away and out of sight. Pepper, Jack, and the
others surrounded Andy. They saw he was very
pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too much for you, Andy,&rdquo; said the
young major. &ldquo;Come on out in the fresh air,&rdquo;
and he led the way. On the campus he ran into
Reff Ritter once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, what do you mean by bumping into
me,&rdquo; he said, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t bumping into you,&rdquo; was the sharp
reply. &ldquo;Say, maybe you&rsquo;d like to meet me in the
gym. some day,&rdquo; went on the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At chinning?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, on the bars, or the flying-rings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid to meet you on the flying-rings,&rdquo;
answered Jack, for that form of gymnastics
appealed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, when do you want to meet me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done.&rdquo; And then and there, with the aid of
several outsiders, the contest on the flying-rings
was arranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, I am afraid you&rsquo;ll get the worst of it,&rdquo;
said Pepper, for he remembered that Reff Ritter
had travelled a good deal and had had several
high-class instructors give him lessons in gymnastics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; returned the young major. &ldquo;But I
wasn&rsquo;t going to show the white feather when he
called on me to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further discussion of the subject was cut short
by the unexpected ringing of the school bell. At
first the cadets thought this must be some joke,
but soon learned otherwise. They were requested
to meet in the assembly room, and were there
addressed by Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an announcement of considerable importance
to make,&rdquo; said the master of the Hall.
&ldquo;To-morrow afternoon this school will be visited
by two of my old army friends, General Wallack
and Major Darrowburg. General Wallack has
been on duty on the Pacific coast and Major Darrowburg
is one of the instructors at West Point.
I shall ask these two old army friends of mine to
inspect the school battalion and witness a drill.
It is perhaps needless for me to say that I wish
you all to appear at your best. I want every uniform
carefully brushed, every shoe polished, and
every gun and sword in the pink of condition.
These gentlemen are deeply interested in our
school, and I want them to see for themselves
that we are close to the standard set by our government
at West Point. To-morrow we will have
dinner an hour earlier than usual, and that will
give all ample time in which to make themselves
presentable. I trust that every officer and every
private will take a proper pride in this exhibition.
And I wish to add, that any neglect on the part of
an officer or a private to turn out in a fitting manner
will be severely punished. Now you can go,
and I trust you will, every one of you, add to
the honor of Putnam Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The cadets filed out of the assembly room and
scattered in various directions. The announcement
made by Captain Putnam created a keen
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will certainly be great to be inspected by
two regular United States Army officers,&rdquo; observed
Pepper. &ldquo;Gosh! but we&rsquo;ll have to shine
up for keeps! Guess I&rsquo;ll begin on my brass buttons
right away!&rdquo; And he said this so drolly all
who heard him laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to clean my gun,&rdquo; said Stuffer. &ldquo;I
meant to clean it last week, but it slipped my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s meself must have a new braid
on me coat,&rdquo; put in Emerald. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo; see
about it to wanct!&rdquo; And he hurried off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve got much to do, Jack,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;You always look as if you had
stepped out of a bandbox. I don&rsquo;t see how you
manage it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know I have to set the rest of the
battalion an example, being major,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;If the major isn&rsquo;t up to the scratch how
can he expect his men to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that&rsquo;s the way to look at it, but
I really don&rsquo;t see how you keep your sword looking
so fine, and your scabbard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I polish it pretty often&mdash;then it doesn&rsquo;t come
hard, Pep. The whole secret is in not letting
things slip too long. When I find a button getting
loose I don&rsquo;t wait for it to fall off&mdash;I tighten
it up right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jack and his chums were talking matters
over on the campus Coulter, Ritter, and Paxton
had walked off toward the boat-house. They
took but little interest in the inspection, until an
idea regarding it entered Ritter&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did what I could to lame Snow,&rdquo; said Paxton
to Coulter. &ldquo;I kicked his wrist as hard as I
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not in condition&mdash;my stomach has been
weak for two days,&rdquo; was Coulter&rsquo;s explanation.
&ldquo;Another time I&rsquo;ll beat him all to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Reff, you had a run-in with Jack Ruddy,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Paxton, turning to Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Ritter was clicking his teeth together&mdash;something
he was in the habit of doing when
out of sorts. &ldquo;Say, I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wonder?&rdquo; asked Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of that exhibition drill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! I am not going to worry about
that. Why, if we make a fine showing who will
get the credit? Captain Putnam, Jack Ruddy,
and the other officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to make a good showing for
Jack Ruddy&rsquo;s benefit,&rdquo; growled Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of something,&rdquo; resumed Reff
Ritter, slowly. &ldquo;I wonder if we could manage
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manage what?&rdquo; asked the two others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manage to make a whole lot of trouble for
Jack Ruddy and his crowd. It falls in with the
first idea I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to do it!&rdquo; declared Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; added Coulter. &ldquo;Only show us
a safe and sure way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how Ruddy keeps himself in the
very best of condition all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t help but know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, supposing we spoilt that condition for
him? Supposing we made his sword and its
scabbard look rusty, his buttons dull, and his
uniform full of spots? How would that strike
those officers and Captain Putnam when that inspection
came off?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know one thing&mdash;Captain Putnam would be
as mad as hops,&rdquo; said Paxton. &ldquo;More than likely
he would reduce Ruddy to the ranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you can&rsquo;t work such a scheme,&rdquo; said
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not&mdash;if we can get hold of his things
between now and to-morrow noon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if he finds anything is mussed up he&rsquo;ll
do his best to clean up before he goes on the
parade ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what if he doesn&rsquo;t find anything
mussed up?&rdquo; queried Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Paxton.
&ldquo;He has eyes&mdash;he can readily see if anything is
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not&mdash;if we fix him up in the right kind
of a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how are you going to do it?&rdquo; demanded
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do it easily enough, provided I can get
down to the Cedarville drug store to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want from the drug store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want several chemicals. Can I trust you to
keep this a secret?&rdquo; And Reff Ritter looked
around the boat-house to see if any outsiders were
in sight. No one seemed to be around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said both Coulter and Paxton, promptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my plan is simply this: From the druggist
I will get certain chemicals to be mixed with
water. Then, on the sly, we&rsquo;ll get hold of Ruddy&rsquo;s
outfit. All we&rsquo;ll have to do is to apply the
chemicals to his sword, scabbard, buttons, and
clothing. We can dilute the chemicals so that
they will act in two, three or four hours, just as
we please. At first the chemicals will not show
at all, but after the proper length of time they
will turn everything they are on a sickly green. I
know the action of the chemicals well, for I have
used them in photography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea!&rdquo; cried Coulter. &ldquo;Let us
try it by all means. And we&rsquo;ll put some on Andy
Snow&rsquo;s outfit, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and on Pepper Ditmore&rsquo;s things,&rdquo; broke
in Paxton. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with doing up the
whole Ruddy crowd while we are at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
make that inspection drill the worst looking affair
that ever took place at Putnam Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and bring seven kinds of trouble to
Jack Ruddy and his crowd,&rdquo; finished Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">AT THE DRUG STORE</span></h2>
<p>Andy wanted his gun cleaned and oiled, and
as his wrist was in no condition for use, Pepper
volunteered to do the work. In the meantime
Jack went around to several students whom he
knew were usually careless in their appearance
and told them they must brush up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want every cadet to appear in first-class
form,&rdquo; said the young major. &ldquo;Captain Putnam
is depending upon me to have everything perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make everything shine like a
looking-glass,&rdquo; said Dale, &ldquo;even if I have to work
all night to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and I want to look foine meself,&rdquo; put
in Hogan. &ldquo;Mebbe, some day, I&rsquo;ll be afther joining
the regular army, I dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;West Point would just suit me,&rdquo; added Henry
Lee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Having made a tour of the school and set many
cadets to work cleaning up, the young major
looked over his own things. A button on his
coat wanted fastening and that was all. His
sword and scabbard were as bright as a new
silver dollar, and it must be confessed that he
looked at them with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Captain Putnam will introduce me
to those regular army officers,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and
if he does I want to look my very best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time later, having placed his outfit in the
closet where it belonged, Jack joined Pepper and
Andy. The former had finished cleaning the
acrobatic cadet&rsquo;s gun and was now at work on
his own.</p>
<p>The three boys were talking among themselves
when they noticed a cadet named Billy Sabine
lounging near watching them curiously. It may
be mentioned here that Sabine was an odd sort
of youth&mdash;sometimes very good and sometimes
very bad. He had been a toady to Dan Baxter
and to Coulter. But when Reff Ritter came on
the scene Billy had not been treated with the consideration
he thought was due him, and, as a
consequence, he was rather down on Ritter and
his cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sabine acts as if he wanted something,&rdquo; remarked
Pepper. &ldquo;Wonder what he&rsquo;s got on his
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call him over and find out,&rdquo; said Jack,
and beckoned to the distant boy. Sabine came
up slowly, as though revolving something of importance
in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Billy, how goes it?&rdquo; began the young
major, sociably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; was Sabine&rsquo;s short reply. &ldquo;Going
to have a great drill to-morrow, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope to have. And I trust you&rsquo;ll polish
up for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m always polished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are, and I am glad of it. I wish
I could say as much for every cadet in the battalion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, and Billy Sabine rubbed
his chin with his hand, a habit he had when turning
something over in his mind. He was rather
a slow thinker at the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, are you polished up?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to put on your best front, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you had better watch out that somebody
doesn&rsquo;t play a trick on you,&rdquo; and with this
remark Billy Sabine started to walk away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play a trick?&rdquo; repeated the young major.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;you watch out, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy must know of something,&rdquo; cried Pepper,
his suspicions aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call him back,&rdquo; added Andy, and this was
done. The other boy returned rather unwillingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is going to play a trick on me?&rdquo; demanded
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t say he was going to play
a trick&mdash;I only said for you to watch out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You act as if you knew of something,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;If you do you had better say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I thought I&rsquo;d warn you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you know&mdash;come, out with it,&rdquo;
and now Jack caught the cadet by the arm, so
that he could not run away. Billy Sabine looked
around suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I tell you, you won&rsquo;t give me away, will
you?&rdquo; he asked, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t say a word unless you promise. I&rsquo;m
not going to get myself in a hole on your account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do know something!&rdquo; cried Pepper.
&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t tell us what it is, and
anything happens, we&rsquo;ll blame you, so there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do anything!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sabine, in fresh alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; said Jack, and now his
voice was stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I was down back of the boat-house
awhile ago and I heard Reff Ritter, Gus Coulter,
and Nick Paxton talking. They are all down on
your crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that,&rdquo; answered Pepper, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t see me, and I heard most of what
they said, although not all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did they say?&rdquo; questioned Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First they talked about you&rdquo;&mdash;Sabine nodded
to the young major. &ldquo;Ritter has a plan to spoil
your things&mdash;sword and all that&mdash;so they
won&rsquo;t show up good at the inspection. He is
going to get something down to the Cedarville
drug store to-night and sprinkle or rub it on
everything. After Ritter unfolded his plan he
and the others agreed to fix up your whole crowd
in the same way&mdash;so the inspection would be
ruined, so far as you were concerned. They
want to put you in disgrace with Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that Billy Sabine told the particulars as
far as he knew them. Jack and his chums listened
with keen interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to report this to the captain!&rdquo; cried
Andy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most outrageous thing I ever
heard of!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;This will bring disgrace to Captain Putnam
as well as ourselves,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
believe in carrying tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, you promised not to get me into
trouble,&rdquo; came hastily and anxiously from Sabine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We promised nothing of the sort,&rdquo; returned
Jack. &ldquo;But I think we can attend to this trick
ourselves, without alarming Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go to Ritter and his gang and punch
their heads for them?&rdquo; demanded Andy. &ldquo;I
guess I can do something, even with this sore
wrist of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; cried Pepper, suddenly.
&ldquo;Just the thing&mdash;if we can work it.&rdquo; He
turned to Sabine. &ldquo;Are you sure Ritter is going
to get those chemicals at Cedarville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do to put a
spoke in his wheel when he least suspects it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Reff Ritter appeared not far
away, and at once Billy Sabine walked off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say a word about me,&rdquo; he pleaded,
as he departed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what is your plan?&rdquo; asked Jack of Pepper,
some time later, when they and Andy were
left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is simply this, to go to Cedarville
and head off Ritter&rsquo;s little game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to stop him from going to the drug
store?&rdquo; queried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. The druggist has a new clerk,
a fellow named Charley Fowler. I know him
quite well. If I can see Fowler before Ritter
gets there I think I can get him to play into our
hands. Now do you catch the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right&mdash;if you can get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have as good a chance as Ritter,&rdquo;
answered Pepper; and then the bell rang for the
parade previous to supper.</p>
<p>It was no easy matter for Pepper to get off
that evening, but when he told Mr. Strong that
he wanted to see a friend in Cedarville on important
business he was allowed leave of absence
until nine o&rsquo;clock, and as the cadets frequently
went in pairs, he was allowed to take Andy with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes on the Ritter crowd,&rdquo; said
Jack, &ldquo;and make sure they don&rsquo;t play some trick
of another kind during your absence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>In a roundabout way Pepper and Andy learned
that Reff Ritter and Gus Coulter were going to
Cedarville on their bicycles. As soon as they
heard this the two chums got out their own
wheels, pumped up the tires, and were off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do a little spurting,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;Ritter and Coulter are both fast riders
and we want to get to town quite awhile ahead
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was still fairly light, so that they did not
need lamps. They pedaled along with vigor, up
hill and down, until the lights of the town shone
in the distance. Without slacking speed they
took to the main street and slacked up only when
the drug store came into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if only the clerk is in charge,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the proprietor very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, let us take our wheels to the rear,&rdquo;
suggested Andy. &ldquo;Then if we want to get out
in a hurry we can do it without Ritter and Coulter
seeing us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They placed their bicycles in a shed at the
back of the drug store and then hurried around
again to the front. As they went in they met
the proprietor coming out. This caused the
cadets to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, what can I do for you?&rdquo; asked
the clerk, as he came forward and nodded pleasantly
to Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can do a whole lot for us, Charley,&rdquo;
answered Pepper, and continued: &ldquo;Anybody
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the boss just went out. I am in sole
charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be in charge for the next hour or
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in charge until I shut up. The boss is
not coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now I want to explain something,&rdquo;
went on the Imp, and as speedily as possible related
what Billy Sabine had told about the trick
Ritter proposed to play. The drug-store clerk
was intensely interested, and as he had taken
quite a fancy to Pepper he readily consented to
do what the other proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can fix this Ritter up with a little colored
water and alcohol,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That mixture
won&rsquo;t harm your outfits in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket!&rdquo; exclaimed Andy, with a
grin.</p>
<p>The boys then purchased some root beer to
drink, and treated the clerk to a cigar&mdash;for he
was fond of smoking. A minute later, looking
out of the doorway, Andy saw Ritter and Coulter
coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where we make our escape,&rdquo; he said,
and he and Pepper ran for a back door. They
got out into the yard just as Ritter came into the
drug store by the front door. Out in the yard
it was dark, so the boys felt little fear of detection.</p>
<p>They listened at an open window and heard
Ritter ask for several chemicals in liquid form.
The clerk came to the rear, behind the prescription
partition, and filled several bottles as he had
promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of these are poison,&rdquo; he said to his
customer. &ldquo;You want to be careful how you use
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know all about that,&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By law I can&rsquo;t sell you these without a written
doctor&rsquo;s prescription,&rdquo; went on the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be all right,&rdquo; put in Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t dare to put our labels on the bottles,&rdquo;
added the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on any old thing,&rdquo; answered Ritter. &ldquo;We
are not buying labels&mdash;we are buying chemicals.&rdquo;
And then the clerk pasted plain bits of paper on
the bottles and scribbled on them with a lead
pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take some packages of cigarettes, too,&rdquo;
said Ritter, after the bottles were delivered to
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time for us to get out,&rdquo; whispered Pepper
to his chum. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be on the way to the Hall
in a few minutes more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll likely stop for a smoke,&rdquo; answered
Andy. &ldquo;But we might as well get back&mdash;we
have accomplished what we came for. Won&rsquo;t
they be mad when they learn how they have been
fooled!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">A SCARE ON THE ROAD</span></h2>
<p>Carrying their wheels to the back of the yard
behind the drug store, the two cadets lifted them
over a board fence and jumped after them. Then
they crossed a vacant lot and came out on a
back street. Here they lit their bicycle lamps
and then leaped into the saddles and were off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine night for a ride,&rdquo; observed Andy.
&ldquo;Wish we didn&rsquo;t have to go right back to the
Hall. I&rsquo;d like to take a spin of ten or twelve
miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might go around by the upper road,&rdquo;
answered Pepper. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take but half an
hour longer at the most. I don&rsquo;t think Ritter
and Coulter will hurry themselves. They like to
smoke too well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and play pool, Pep. It&rsquo;s a wonder the
captain doesn&rsquo;t find out what they are up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not going to turn tell-tale.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Reaching the main road leading to Putnam
Hall, the two cadets followed this for a quarter
of a mile and then branched off to the left, on
what was familiarly known as the upper road&mdash;since
it ran on higher ground than that which
followed the lake shore. This made a long turn
between the hills to the west of the school and
would give them a ride of four or five miles
extra.</p>
<p>Two miles of the upper road were covered
when Pepper noticed that his lamp was growing
dimmer. He stopped and dismounted and shook
the lamp. No sound from within followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Too bad. I should
have filled it before I started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll lead and you can follow,&rdquo;
answered Andy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there is anything
the matter with the road, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy dashed ahead and Pepper followed him
at a distance of fifty feet. Thus another half-mile
was reeled off. Then Andy slowed up, calling
upon his chum to do the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My front tire is flattened out,&rdquo; declared the
acrobatic cadet. &ldquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t got a bad
puncture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was bad I reckon you would have heard
the air hiss,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The lamp was loosened from the wheel and
turned on the flat tire, and both boys got close to
find the puncture. Presently Pepper detected a
small, sharp thorn sticking in the rubber. It had
made a hole like that of a pin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wind a piece of tape around it,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;That will hold till we get to the Hall, I guess,&rdquo;
and he brought out the bicycle tape from his repair
bag.</p>
<p>Both boys were hard at work, bending over the
wheel in the dim light of the lamp, when they
were startled by hearing voices close to them.
On both sides of the road were trees and bushes
and the spot was certainly a lonely one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is coming&mdash;&rdquo; began Pepper, when
two figures stepped into the road and confronted
the cadets.</p>
<p>The boys were amazed and alarmed, and with
good reason. The figures were those of big boys
or men, and each wore a green hood and a green
mask which entirely concealed his face and head.
More than this, each wore gloves with the finger-tips
missing. Both carried heavy clubs in their
hands.</p>
<p>For the moment the boys were so astonished
they neither spoke nor moved. Then both leaped
up and confronted the newcomers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have them!&rdquo; said one of the masked figures.
&ldquo;We have them at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have them,&rdquo; answered the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you surrender?&rdquo; demanded the first
speaker of Andy and Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender? What for?&rdquo; Pepper managed to
ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall know in due time. If you surrender,
hand over your pocketbook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any pocketbook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have, and it has exactly two hundred
dollars in it,&rdquo; said the second masked fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want both of your pocketbooks,&rdquo; went
on the first one who had spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any pocketbook, either,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a mistake in tackling us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take them to the cave for ransom!&rdquo;
cried the second fellow, and began to march
around, waving his club over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pep, this is a trick!&rdquo; whispered the acrobatic
youth. &ldquo;Some of the fellows have followed us.
Maybe they are going to initiate us in some new
secret society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jinks, that&rsquo;s so! Say, it would be great
if we could get away from them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give up your pocketbooks?&rdquo; demanded
the first of the masked figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and your red dancing-slippers,&rdquo; added
the second masked figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the cadets, beyond a doubt,&rdquo; whispered
Pepper. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got no time for any
initiations to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pretend to submit,&rdquo; answered Andy, in
an equally low voice. &ldquo;If I can only get this
wheel pumped up it will be all right.&rdquo; For the
tire tape was now in place over the puncture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you?&rdquo; demanded both figures, coming
to a halt by the roadside, with clubs upraised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us mend this wheel first and we&rsquo;ll do
whatever you want,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well, proceed,&rdquo; answered the leading
masked person.</p>
<p>Andy already had his pocket-pump out, and
he proceeded with all haste to pump up the tire.
Then he put the pump back into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take up your wheel,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Ride
like mad when you get the chance. I am going
to try to scare them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money!&rdquo; roared one of the masked persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; screamed Andy, suddenly, and
pointed into the woods. &ldquo;The trees are on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two masked figures wheeled around in
fright. As they did this Andy and Pepper gave
their wheels a push and leaped into the saddles.
They pedalled with vigor and were soon fifty
feet away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come back! Come back!&rdquo; yelled the two
masked persons, in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night!&rdquo; called back Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to find somebody else to initiate,&rdquo;
added Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the luck!&rdquo; muttered one of the
masked figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought we had them prisoners,&rdquo; added
the second masked person.</p>
<p>Laughing merrily over their escape, Andy and
Pepper continued on their way to Putnam Hall.
The darkness of the night speedily hid the two
masked figures from their view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you discover who they were?&rdquo; questioned
the acrobatic youth, as they came in sight of the
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. First I thought one of the fellows was
Bart Conners, but he didn&rsquo;t talk much like Bart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their voices had a familiar tone to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that. Well, whoever they were,
they got left this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe a whole crowd of them were back in
the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. If so, we can find out who they
are when they steal back into the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea. Let us watch for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cadets found Jack and the others
anxiously awaiting their return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter and Coulter just came in,&rdquo; said the
young major. &ldquo;Ritter carried something in his
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right&mdash;the drug clerk said it wouldn&rsquo;t
hurt our things a bit,&rdquo; answered Pepper, and
then he and Andy told of what had taken place
at Cedarville and on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear of any new secret societies,&rdquo;
said Dale, who was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Jack. &ldquo;But some of the fellows
may be getting them up. It&rsquo;s a mistake,
though, to have initiations to-night. If the boys
stay up late they&rsquo;ll be as sleepy as owls at the
inspection to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to find out who those chaps are&mdash;if
I possibly can,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;I am going to
stay up, at least for awhile, and see if I can spot
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do the same,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>Satisfied that no harm would now come to
their outfits, Jack and the others retired. Andy
and Pepper waited until all were asleep and then
one stationed himself at a window on the east
side of the Hall and the other at a window on the
west.</p>
<p>For a good hour nobody appeared. Then
Andy saw some figures moving down near the
boat-house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;The same pair, and they still have on the
masks and hoods,&rdquo; he said, after calling Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; said Pepper, a minute later,
as the two masked figures approached the Hall.
Then the two persons below passed out of sight
behind the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose we had best do now?&rdquo;
questioned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till they come upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited, and thus ten, fifteen, twenty minutes
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they are not coming up,&rdquo; began Andy,
when he heard a door close. Then came a murmuring
of voices, and he and the Imp saw the
dim forms of two cadets coming up a side stairs.
The newcomers tiptoed their way along a corridor
and one slipped into one dormitory and the
other hurried into the room next to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Nelson and Harry Blossom!&rdquo; whispered
Pepper. &ldquo;Who would have thought it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they belonged to anything
new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I. Well, we fooled them nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us quiz them about it when we get the
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Andy and Pepper were tired enough to go to
bed, and it did not take them long to get to sleep.
When they awoke the Hall bell was clanging
loudly. They were a little late, and so were some
of the others, and there was a great rush to get
dressed and downstairs on time.</p>
<p>The morning session was a brief one. During
that period Reff Ritter got excused from his class
for ten minutes, and Gus Coulter also got a leave
of absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to go out a few minutes, Mr.
Strong,&rdquo; said Jack to the assistant teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Major Ruddy,&rdquo; was the answer,
and Jack hurried away and after Ritter and
Coulter. He saw the conspirators go to a closet
and get out two bottles of light-colored liquid.
Then they visited the dormitory occupied by Jack
and his friends, and also the rack where the
cadets kept their swords and guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do with the empty bottles?&rdquo;
Jack heard Coulter ask, as he and Ritter passed
a door behind which the young major was in
hiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them in Sabine&rsquo;s closet,&rdquo; answered Ritter.
&ldquo;Then, if the worst comes to the worst, I
can say that little sneak was in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Coulter, and the proposal
was immediately carried out. Then the
two conspirators went back to their class-room.
But Jack got in ahead of them, and was deep in
a history lesson when they entered.</p>
<p>The morning session at an end, it was announced
that dinner would be served in the mess-room
in a quarter of an hour. Losing no time,
Jack and his chums ran to inspect their outfits.
They found some parts of their uniforms damp,
where the liquid from the bottles had been poured
over them. The guns and Jack&rsquo;s sword were
also moist, but these were readily dried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope the drug clerk didn&rsquo;t make any
mistake,&rdquo; said the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know for certain after dinner,&rdquo; answered
Andy.</p>
<p>The visitors had already arrived, and Captain
Putnam had had a salute from the new cannon
on the campus fired in their honor, and was now
entertaining them in his private dining-room.
The cadets marched into the mess-room for dinner,
and half an hour later dispersed, to prepare
for the inspection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE INSPECTION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Battalion, attention! Shoulder arms! Forward
march!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="THE INSPECTION." width="500" height="771" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">THE INSPECTION.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The drums beat, the fifes struck up a lively air,
and off marched the two companies of Putnam
Hall cadets, across the campus and back, down
the road a pace, and then formed in a long line
fronting the school building. Every sword shone
like silver, every gun was bright, and every uniform
was brushed to its best. At the head of
the command was Major Jack Ruddy, as stiff as
a ramrod, looking the equal of any West Point
cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Battalion, attention! Carry arms! Support
arms! Shoulder arms! Right face! Left face!
About face. Load! Aim! Fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One order after another was delivered by Jack,
and the cadets of the two companies obeyed like
one big machine. Only two boys were a little
slow, Reff Ritter and Gus Coulter. Paxton
wanted to drag, too, but did not dare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good! Very good indeed!&rdquo; cried General
Wallack, enthusiastically. &ldquo;Captain Putnam,
you are to be congratulated on having such
a body of students under you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not dream they could drill so well,&rdquo;
added Major Darrowburg. &ldquo;Why, you are almost,
if not quite, up to our West Point standard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you will do me the honor to inspect
them more closely, General Wallack,&rdquo; said Captain
Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; answered the regular army
officer. &ldquo;Major, will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; answered Major Darrowburg.</p>
<p>The two United States army officers came
down from the piazza of the school followed by
Captain Putnam. They approached Major
Ruddy, who immediately saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Major John Ruddy,&rdquo; said the master
of Putnam Hall. &ldquo;Ruddy, this is General Wallack
and this is Major Darrowburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to meet you, young man,&rdquo; said the army
general, and shook hands. &ldquo;Some day I presume
you&rsquo;ll be in the regular army,&rdquo; and he
smiled pleasantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Jack. Then he shook
hands with Major Darrowburg, and after that
answered a number of questions put to him. The
visitors praised the drill that had taken place
and this made the young major blush not a little.
But he was very happy, and doubly so to
think that he had outwitted Reff Ritter and his
cronies. His uniform did not show a spot and
his sword and scabbard were as bright as the
polish used could make them.</p>
<p>An inspection lasting fully half an hour followed,
Captain Putnam showing his visitors
along the line of cadets. Nearly everybody was
smiling and happy. Only a few boys looked
glum, and those lads were Reff Ritter and his
cohorts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A really remarkable showing,&rdquo; was General
Wallack&rsquo;s comment, after the inspection was
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could always do as well as this at the
Point we&rsquo;d have nothing to worry about,&rdquo; added
Major Darrowburg. &ldquo;Captain Putnam, you certainly
ought to feel proud of your school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proud,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>After the inspection the cadets marched around
the campus once more. They were about to be
dismissed when Pepper signed to Jack, who in
turn beckoned to Captain Putnam and whispered
something into his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no harm in it,&rdquo; said the master of the
Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Battalion, attention!&rdquo; called out Jack. &ldquo;I
move we give three cheers for General Wallack
and Major Darrowburg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried the cadets, and the cheers
were given with a will. Then the two army officers
bowed and made little speeches, and more
cheers followed; and that was the end of the
inspection. Soon the visitors were driven away
by Captain Putnam in the Hall carriage, and
George Strong announced that for the rest of
the day the cadets might do as they pleased, so
long as they did not leave the Hall grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a perfect success,&rdquo; said George Strong
to the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad of it, Mr. Strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Captain Putnam is greatly pleased.
I am sure he will have something to say to the
boys when he gets back.&rdquo; And Mr. Strong was
right, the master of the Hall complimented all
on their appearance and deportment, and said he
was sure the visitors had been unusually impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would all do well,&rdquo; said the captain.
&ldquo;But it has surpassed my expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only fellows who were not happy were
Reff Ritter and his cronies. They could not understand
how it was that Jack and his chums
had come forth looking so spotless and bright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;That druggist must have humbugged you,
Reff,&rdquo; said Gus Coulter. &ldquo;I guess he gave you
water instead of those chemicals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it at all,&rdquo; answered Ritter.
&ldquo;But if the druggist did really humbug me I&rsquo;ll
fix him some time, see if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us look at the stuff left in the bottles,&rdquo;
suggested Coulter. &ldquo;Must be a few drops at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two passed into the school. On the stairs
they met Pepper and Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was beastly stuff,&rdquo; said Pepper, in a loud
tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know who used it. If we
hadn&rsquo;t had that patent preparation to take out
the stains we would have been in a pickle, I can
tell you, Jack especially,&rdquo; and then the Imp and
Dale passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it all,&rdquo; groaned Ritter, when he and
Coulter were alone. &ldquo;No need to look for those
bottles now. The stuff worked too quickly, and
those chaps got some other preparation and
cleaned up with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that must be it,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;Well,
better luck next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, Pepper had uttered his words merely
to throw Ritter and his crony off the track,
and the Imp&rsquo;s trick had worked to a charm. Ritter
never learned how he had been fooled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>When Pepper went down into the library that
evening, to get a book to read, he was met by
Andy and Joe Nelson. Andy was quite excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper, we made a mistake last night,&rdquo; cried
the acrobatic youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mistake? What do you mean?&rdquo; and he
looked at Joe Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy tells me that you took me and Harry
Blossom for the fellows with the green masks
and the green hoods,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;You made a
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe and Harry saw those fellows, too,&rdquo; continued
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the back of the Hall&mdash;just as we came in.
We had been down to the boat-house looking for
a gold stickpin Harry lost. We found the pin
in a crack of the floor and then came up to the
school. The men came around a corner. When
they saw us, they ran off, across the corn-patch
back of the barns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they weren&rsquo;t some of the students?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. But, of course, I am not
sure,&rdquo; answered Joe Nelson. &ldquo;You can question
Harry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Harry Blossom was in the music-room, playing
on the piano and singing for the benefit of
several of his friends. Later on, however, he
came away and told what he had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they were strangers, but now you
mention it, I think they may have been some
cadets out on a lark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly no men out to rob anybody would
act as they did,&rdquo; said Pepper, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Why, they acted, for all the world, as if it was
a huge joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a mystery, true enough,&rdquo; said
Andy, and the others agreed with him. They
concluded to say nothing more about the affair,
but to keep their eyes &ldquo;peeled,&rdquo; as Pepper expressed
it, for the next appearance of the two
persons in green.</p>
<p>It galled Reff Ritter to see Jack Ruddy triumphant
in the matter of the inspection, and the
bully wondered to himself how he could make
the young major &ldquo;eat humble pie,&rdquo; as he termed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you meet Ruddy on the flying-rings tomorrow?&rdquo;
asked Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was Ritter&rsquo;s short answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you ought to be able to best him there&mdash;you&rsquo;re
such a perfect gymnast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy has been taking extra lessons from
the gym. teacher. I just heard of it this morning.
That&rsquo;s the reason he was so ready to take
me up,&rdquo; responded Reff Ritter, sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid to meet him?&rdquo; asked Paxton
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. But it is going to be no walk-over
to outdo him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d fall and break his neck,&rdquo; growled
Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. But he won&rsquo;t fall&mdash;he is too strong
and steady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reff Ritter walked down to the gymnasium in
a thoughtful mood. Only a few boys were about
and none near the flying-rings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could fix it so Ruddy would get a
good tumble,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It would serve him
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped up on the flying-rings and tried one
pair after another. He had a notion to cut some
of the ropes half in two, but reflected that this
might bring harm to somebody else instead of
the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if I could dope him?&rdquo; mused the
bully. &ldquo;Let me see, how did that fellow in Paris
do that trick? He told me all about it at that
boxing match. Ah, I have it! The question is,
can I work the game without being caught?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Ritter knew he must go at what was in his
mind with extreme caution. He remembered that
Jack was a copious water-drinker, and usually
drank one glass of water at least at every meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my cue,&rdquo; said the bully to himself.
&ldquo;Now, if I can only get the stuff out of the Hall
medicine closet.&rdquo; He referred to a medicine
closet located at the back of the main hall of the
school. In this were kept a variety of medicines,
to be used in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Once Reff had been sick, and to make him
sleep&mdash;for he was very wide-awake and nervous
at the time&mdash;Captain Putnam had given him some
kind of powder in water. This had lulled his
senses to repose in a short time. He remembered
that box with the white powder very well.</p>
<p>It had been arranged that Jack should meet
Ritter that evening, shortly after supper&mdash;during
the off hour of that part of the day. If Reff
could only get some of that powder into Jack&rsquo;s
drinking-water during the evening meal he felt
certain the young major would soon feel too dull
and sleepy to make much of a showing on the
flying-rings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>With the craft of a real criminal, Ritter stole
into the main hall of the school and looked
around. Nobody was in sight, and swiftly he
approached the medicine closet and opened it.
There were numerous boxes and bottles there,
and the appearance of them somewhat confused
the rascally youth. He read the various inscriptions
and at last picked out a square box containing
several spoonfuls of a white powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the stuff,&rdquo; he murmured, and just
then he heard somebody coming down the main
stairs. He closed the medicine closet swiftly, tip-toed
his way across the hall and entered one of
the class-rooms. Here several of the windows
were open and he dropped from one of these, nobody
being in the room at the time. In a few
seconds more he had stepped around the corner
of the building and then he turned to a side door
and entered the mess-room of Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>The mess-room, or dining-hall, was a long,
low room, with windows on one side. There
were half a dozen long tables and the chairs at
these tables were numbered. Jack, as the major
of the battalion, sat at one end of one of the
tables. At the other end of this table sat Josiah
Crabtree when he was at the school, but just
now this seat was not being used.</p>
<p>Watching his opportunity Reff Ritter slipped
up to the seat the young major usually occupied.
On the table in front of this seat was a glass of
ice-water, and into this Ritter skillfully dropped
a generous portion of the white powder from the
box. Then he glided out of the mess-room just
as the gong sounded for the evening parade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see what we will see, Jack Ruddy!&rdquo;
he muttered to himself. &ldquo;If you drink that I
don&rsquo;t think your performance on the flying-rings
this evening will amount to much!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">WHAT HAPPENED TO JACK</span></h2>
<p>The cadets of Putnam Hall were soon seated
for supper. This was usually a plain but substantial
meal, and generally all the boys ate well.</p>
<p>Jack marched in at the head of the battalion
and took his seat. A minute later he reached for
his glass of water. He was thirsty and drank
half the contents of the glass before stopping.
As he placed the tumbler back on the table he
made a wry face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That water isn&rsquo;t good,&rdquo; he observed to Dale,
who sat close to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s the ice in it,&rdquo; answered Dale.
&ldquo;I thought yesterday the ice had a peculiar
flavor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be it,&rdquo; went on the young major.
Then he started to eat and thought no more of
the water. But before he had finished the meal
he drained the glass and called for more. Somewhat
to his surprise the second glass of water
tasted much better.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Maybe there was
something in that first glass, although I didn&rsquo;t
see anything. Perhaps one of the fellows put a
little salt in, just for fun.&rdquo; Then he dismissed
the subject from his mind.</p>
<p>Word had been passed around that the young
major was to meet Reff Ritter in the gymnasium
and a crowd of students collected to witness the
proposed contest. Jack went down with Pepper
and his other chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel for the trial?&rdquo; questioned
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you didn&rsquo;t eat enough to make you
lazy,&rdquo; came from Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; ye can thrust Jack to take care av
himself,&rdquo; broke in Emerald. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll beat Ritter
all to pieces, so he will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reff Ritter came down with Paxton and Coulter,
and lost no time in getting into his &ldquo;gym.
togs,&rdquo; as the cadets called their athletic outfits.
Jack speedily followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is to go at it first?&rdquo; asked Joe Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is for Dave Kearney to decide. He is
to be referee and judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can toss up a cent for it,&rdquo; said Dave.
This was done, and Reff Ritter obtained first
chance to show what he could do. Each contestant
was to have three chances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Ritter leaped up on the flying-rings, and amid
utter silence gave an exhibition lasting fully five
minutes. As my old readers know, he was really
quite a gymnast, and what he did brought forth
considerable applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack, show us what you can do,&rdquo; said
Pepper, as the young major stepped to the front.</p>
<p>Jack leaped up and grasped the rings. He had
been feeling very good, but now a strange sleepiness
seemed to be overtaking him. He began to
swing and to do various acts done by Ritter, but
his efforts were, by comparison, awkward and
clumsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Major Ruddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t half as good as what Ritter did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack doesn&rsquo;t seem to be on his mettle at all
to-night,&rdquo; whispered Stuffer to Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Jack, old boy, and show &rsquo;em what
you can really do!&rdquo; cried Pepper, encouragingly.</p>
<p>Jack heard the cries and did all he could to
throw off that sleepy feeling. By sheer willpower
he made a brilliant turn or two which
called for hearty applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jack dropped to the floor Reff Ritter again
mounted, and now the bully &ldquo;put in his best
licks.&rdquo; There was cheering and hand-clapping.
Ritter had already been awarded the first trial,
and now it looked as if he would win the second
also.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack, brace up and show &rsquo;em what you
can do when your mind is on it,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do better than he did, I am sure you
can,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go at it quite so slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m feeling unusually dull to-night,&rdquo; answered
the young major. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know
what to make of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you had better postpone the affair,
then?&rdquo; said Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t going to be postponed!&rdquo; cried Coulter,
who heard the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; murmured Pepper. &ldquo;Are you running
this affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but Ritter is winning, and Jack Ruddy
has no right to withdraw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to withdraw,&rdquo; answered Jack,
gritting his teeth. &ldquo;I am going ahead, and I am
going to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang to the flying-rings and began to
swing strongly. Then he made a turn and tried
to make another. All at once everything seemed
to dance before his eyes. He felt his grip relaxing.
Then all became dark, and he felt himself
falling&mdash;falling&mdash;falling&mdash;and he knew no
more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is falling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were some of the cries which rang
through the gymnasium as the young major was
seen to let go with one hand, swing limply for a
few seconds, and then let go with the other.
Pepper, Andy, and Dale rushed forward, and
between them they broke the fall that otherwise
might have proved serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has fainted!&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Let us carry
him into the open air,&rdquo; and this was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he is only shamming,&rdquo; grunted Gus
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; added Paxton. &ldquo;He was afraid
of losing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Ruddy isn&rsquo;t that kind of a boy, and if
you say he is I&rsquo;ll punch your head!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dale, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; something is wrong wid him,&rdquo; was
Hogan&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as pale as a ghost, so
he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was placed on a bench outside of the
gymnasium, and while Pepper ran for some water
Andy fanned him vigorously. In the meantime,
some small boys ran off to tell Mr. Strong and
Captain Putnam of what had occurred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack! Jack!&rdquo; cried Pepper, bending over his
chum. &ldquo;Jack, what is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jack did not answer. His eyes were
closed and now his arms and legs seemed to be
getting stiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something more than a mere faint,&rdquo;
said Stuffer. &ldquo;I think we had better call Captain
Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes now,&rdquo; said Bart Conners.
&ldquo;Mr. Strong is with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble here?&rdquo; demanded the
master of the Hall, as he and his assistant came
up almost on the run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong with Jack,&rdquo; explained
Pepper. &ldquo;He was on the flying-rings&mdash;in a contest
with Ritter, when all of a sudden he acted
queer-like and fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he had a rush of blood to the head,&rdquo;
suggested Mr. Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t act like that,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>As Jack showed no signs of reviving, he was
carried to the Hall, and Peleg Snuggers was sent
off for Doctor Fremley, of Cedarville, who was
the regular school physician. In the meantime
Captain Putnam did what he could for the sufferer.
His army experience had taught him a
great deal, yet he was much puzzled by the case
before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand this,&rdquo; he said to George
Strong. &ldquo;He looked to be the picture of health
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, sir,&rdquo; answered the assistant teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he ate or drank something that didn&rsquo;t
agree with him,&rdquo; suggested Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He complained of the water at supper,&rdquo; came
from Dale. &ldquo;I told him it might be the ice in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ice is of the best,&rdquo; answered Captain
Putnam. &ldquo;It may have been the food, but if so,
why has not somebody else been taken sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After what seemed to be an unusually long
time, Doctor Fremley appeared. He had driven
at top speed to the Hall, and the team was covered
with lather. By this time Jack had been
removed to a private bedroom and undressed.
He lay like a log, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>The physician was almost as much puzzled as
were the others. But acting on the theory that
Jack might have been poisoned by something he
had eaten the doctor used a stomach pump. This
brought up something of a peculiar bluish color,
which surprised the medical man a great deal.
He nodded his head knowingly and then proceeded
to give Jack a dose of medicine from the
little case he carried. In a short while the young
major gasped loudly and opened his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, doctor?&rdquo; asked the master of the
Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite sure, but it looks to me like an
overdose of French headache powders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the Saligne preparation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;then you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some in our medicine closet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could this young man get at the stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I will go and see if the box has been
tampered with,&rdquo; continued Captain Putnam and
hurried off. He came back quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried the physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The box is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure you had it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive. I gave a small dose to one of the
servant girls only night before last. She complained
of a severe headache, and it aided her in
getting to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, this looks as if this young man
had gotten the box and taken an overdose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he get over it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But, let me add, he has had a close call
from death. If I had not used the pump and
given him that medicine to counteract the effect
of the powder he might never have regained
consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plain statement from Doctor Fremley
made all present shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Jack should take the powder,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say anything to me
about a headache. He told me he was feeling
fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he told me the same thing,&rdquo; declared
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he was a bit nervous over this gymnastic
contest and thought to quiet his nerves,&rdquo;
suggested George Strong. &ldquo;But I must admit
that doesn&rsquo;t look like Major Ruddy. I never
knew him to be nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know what nervousness means,&rdquo;
declared Andy. &ldquo;If he took the powder I guess
he did it by mistake. Maybe he thought it was
for indigestion, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this talk was going on in the bedroom,
Reff Ritter was downstairs in the library, surrounded
by a number of his friends. The bully
was ill at ease. He had not expected the grave
turn affairs had taken. Jack was certainly in
bad shape. What if the young major should
die? A shiver ran down Ritter&rsquo;s backbone, which
he tried in vain to conceal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, are you cold?&rdquo; asked
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;m a little upset,&rdquo; answered the
bully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; declared Paxton. &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t your fault that Ruddy fainted and fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity he had to faint,&rdquo; went on Coulter.
&ldquo;You would have won that contest beyond the
shadow of a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that,&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter, listlessly.
He hardly heard what was said&mdash;his
mind was in the bedroom where Jack lay. He
wanted to go up&mdash;to learn the actual truth&mdash;but
he did not dare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go back to the gym.?&rdquo; asked Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;er&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll go up to my room,&rdquo;
answered Ritter, and started for the doorway
before anybody could stop him. The others had
never seen him act so strangely, and they looked
at each other in surprise.</p>
<p>Ritter gained the hallway just as Billy Sabine
was coming down the stairs. Sabine was greatly
excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo; asked the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy took an overdose of headache powders,&rdquo;
was the reply. &ldquo;The doctor is working
over him, but they all think he is going to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; gasped Reff Ritter, hoarsely. Then he
staggered backward, clutched at the stair-rail,
and sank heavily on a nearby seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A CHALLENGE FROM PORNELL ACADEMY</span></h2>
<p>It was not until midnight that Jack began to
feel something like himself. He was still weak,
but he could now breathe regularly, and Doctor
Fremley pronounced him out of danger.</p>
<p>Pepper and Andy had begged to be allowed
to remain with their chum, and they were in the
room with Captain Putnam. Leaving some medicine
to be taken regularly every hour, the physician
departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Ruddy, the next time you take any
medicine beware and not take an overdose,&rdquo; said
Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t taken any medicine, Captain Putnam,&rdquo;
answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you take some powder for headache,
or for nervousness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t taken a thing, sir. Why should I?
I felt first-rate up to the time I went to the gym.
Then, all of a sudden, I seemed to get dizzy and
sleepy,&rdquo; explained the sufferer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he hadn&rsquo;t taken anything,&rdquo; broke in
Pepper. &ldquo;I mean knowingly,&rdquo; he hastened to
add.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say, Ditmore, that you think
Major Ruddy took the powder without knowing
what it was?&rdquo; demanded the master of the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look like it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take a thing, I tell you,&rdquo; declared
Jack. &ldquo;Why do you say I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was told of what the doctor had discovered
and was much astonished. He laid back on the
bed, but suddenly sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That water! I felt funny right after I drank
that water!&rdquo; he cried, and then explained what
had occurred at the supper table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will inquire into this in the morning,&rdquo; said
Captain Putnam. &ldquo;If somebody played a trick
on you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He did not finish, but his usually
pleasant face grew hard and stern.</p>
<p>The school was very quiet that night when the
door of one of the dormitories opened and a cadet
crept forth and tip-toed his way through the
semi-dark hallway. He advanced with caution,
trembling greatly for fear of being discovered.
The midnight prowler was Reff Ritter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The affair at the foot of the stairs earlier in
the evening had astonished Billy Sabine, but Reff
had quickly recovered and said it was due to a
cramp in the stomach, brought on by a false twist
when performing on the swinging-rings. Then
the bully had gone to bed&mdash;but not to sleep. Only
one thought filled his mind&mdash;that Jack might die
and that he might be accused of the awful crime.
He shivered and shook under the bedclothes and
could scarcely conceal his fear from his cronies
when they came in.</p>
<p>Now the others were asleep and he was determined
to find out the truth about Jack. If
the young major was really dying&mdash;well, perhaps
it would be best to run away from Putnam
Hall rather than run the risk of exposure and
arrest. This showed that at heart Reff Ritter
was a thorough coward.</p>
<p>Scarcely daring to breathe, the bully tip-toed
his way along one hallway after another until he
came to the door of the room in which Jack lay.
Listening, he heard a murmur of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is alive, he is talking, he is not going to
die!&rdquo; he thought, and a wave of relief swept over
him. Then, with bated breath, he listened to
what the cadets and Captain Putnam had to say.
When the captain prepared to retire, he sped
back to his dormitory and got into bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, Reff?&rdquo; came from Gus
Coulter, who had awakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I went for a&mdash;er&mdash;a drink,&rdquo; stammered
Ritter, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you drink the water in the
pitcher on the stand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s stale and warm. I got a fresh
drink out of the tank in the main hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I just drank from our pitcher and
thought it was all right. Hear anything more
about Ruddy when you were out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; growled Reff, and turned over and pretended
to go to sleep.</p>
<p>He felt relieved in one way, but not in another.
His enemy was not going to die, but on
the other hand Captain Putnam had promised
a rigid investigation. What if he should be discovered?
What if somebody had seen him taking
the powder from the medicine closet, or seen
him putting it in the glass of water?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to face it out,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to face it out, no matter what comes. My
word is as good as anybody&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Captain Putnam&rsquo;s investigation revealed but
little. No person had been seen near the medicine
closet for several days back, and what had
become of the box of headache powder nobody
seemed to know. Regarding the glass of water
drunk by Jack, and the food eaten at supper, the
cook and the colored waiters declared they knew
of nothing wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was any cadet in the mess-room just previous
to supper?&rdquo; asked the master of the school.</p>
<p>At first the waiters said no. But presently one
scratched his head thoughtfully and said he now
remembered that somebody had passed through
the dining-hall after everything was in readiness
for the evening repast. It had been somebody
in uniform, but who he could not remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that person doctored that drinking-water,
or my food,&rdquo; said Jack, when he heard
of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suspect anybody?&rdquo; asked the master
of Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>At this Jack shrugged his shoulders. Yes, he
could suspect several&mdash;Coulter, Paxton, Ritter,
and their cronies&mdash;but what good would that do
if he could not prove somebody guilty?</p>
<p>The next day the young major felt quite like
himself again and rejoined his chums. All went
for a sail on the <i>Alice</i>, and on the trip they talked
the affair over from every possible standpoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was a trick&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t see how it could
be anything else&mdash;it is the most dastardly thing I
ever heard of,&rdquo; declared Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; answered Andy, &ldquo;and the fellow
guilty of it ought to be run out of Putnam
Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect Ritter,&rdquo; said Stuffer, &ldquo;for he wanted
to win that contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; answered Dale. &ldquo;But it
is one thing to suspect a fellow and another thing
to prove the crime. I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything
about it until I could prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if it is possible those fellows with
the green masks and hoods had anything to do
with this?&rdquo; mused Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>Out on the lake they met Fred Century and a
number of the boys from Pornell Academy. Century
was sailing his sloop and told them he had
had little trouble in righting the capsized craft
and in getting her into trim for use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still think the <i>Ajax</i> can beat the <i>Alice</i>,&rdquo; he
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you a regular race in the near
future,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now&mdash;I want to have my mainsail
altered a bit, and get a new tiller. As soon
as I&rsquo;m ready I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>With Century were Will Carey, the youth who
had lost the blue tin box, and Roy Bock, and a
student named Grimes. Bock and Grimes had
caused the Putnam Hall boys much trouble in
the past, and Jack and Pepper did not like them
in the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; cried Roy Bock, presently. &ldquo;You fellows
are so full of challenges I&rsquo;d like to know
if any of you can bowl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; answered Dale, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So can I,&rdquo; added Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got a brand-new alley at our
gym., and any time you want to get up a team
and bowl we&rsquo;ll be ready for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll wipe up the alley with you,&rdquo; added
Grimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you will,&rdquo; retorted Dale, who did not
fancy this style of talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over next Saturday afternoon,&rdquo; said
Roy Bock. &ldquo;Bring over the best team Putnam
Hall can put out. We&rsquo;ll show you how to bowl.&rdquo;
And he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we will come over,&rdquo; answered Stuffer;
and then the two sloops separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bock makes me tired,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not
bowl with him, even if I was good at knocking
over the pins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to beat the Pornell team,&rdquo; answered
Dale. &ldquo;They are such blowers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;They like to blow because they are all rich
boys,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d certainly like to bowl
against them and defeat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could put Emerald on our team,&rdquo; said
Dale. &ldquo;I know he can bowl real well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, go ahead if you want to,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll root for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t want to bowl, Jack?&rdquo; asked
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you and Dale and Stuffer can manage
this. With Emerald you&rsquo;ll make four, and you&rsquo;ll
only want one more man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry Blossom said he could bowl&mdash;and so
did Bart Conners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then you&rsquo;ll have the pick of them,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do like Jack, root.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a bowling alley in the Putnam Hall
gymnasium. It was not a very elaborate affair,
but some of the cadets got much enjoyment from
knocking over the pins. Dale was something of
an expert, often getting a strike or a spare, and
it was but natural, therefore, to make him the
captain of the bowling team.</p>
<p>When spoken to on the subject, Hogan readily
agreed to join the team and so did Bart Conners.
Harry Blossom said he was not in good condition,
but would go along as a substitute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>On the following day Roy Bock sent a formal
challenge by special messenger. He asked for a
game on the Pornell Academy alleys on the following
Saturday at two o&rsquo;clock. He said the
bowling room would hold about one hundred
persons and half the space would be reserved for
the Putnam Hall cadets and their friends.</p>
<p>Permission to accept the challenge was readily
granted by Captain Putnam, and George
Strong was placed in charge of the cadets to visit
the rival school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are at Pornell Academy I want
you all to act like gentlemen,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam.
&ldquo;I want no tricks played, for Doctor Pornell
does not approve of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be as meek as lambs,&rdquo; whispered
Pepper, and grinned to Jack.</p>
<p>Some of the students to visit the rival institution
went over on their bicycles while others took
the carriage and the carryall. Pepper went in the
carryall, and on the sly concealed under one of
the seats a fair-sized box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, we&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; shouted Andy, as the
carryall with the team and half a dozen others
moved away from Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody sing!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and started
up a song one of the students had composed some
time previous:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Do you want to know who we are?</p>
<p class="t">We are boys from Putnam Hall,</p>
<p class="t0">We can row, we can swim, we can skate,</p>
<p class="t">And we can play baseball!</p>
<p class="t0">Our school&rsquo;s the best in the land,</p>
<p class="t">Believe it, it&rsquo;s no mistake!</p>
<p class="t0">You&rsquo;d better come and join,</p>
<p class="t">For we are wide-awake!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This was sung to a lively air composed especially
to fit the words. Then followed something
new, made up by Pepper himself:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Zip! Zam! Here we am!</p>
<p class="t">Hikeadoodle din!</p>
<p class="t0">Give a cheer, for we are here</p>
<p class="t">And we are bound to win!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE BOWLING MATCH</span></h2>
<p>Cheering loudly and blowing their horns, the
cadets of Putnam Hall swept into the grounds of
Pornell Academy. They expected the students
of the rival academy to be lined up, waiting for
them, but in this they were disappointed. Only
a few lads were outside, and they took but little
interest in the newcomers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s this, a frost?&rdquo; queried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;I told you
to beware of Roy Bock and his crowd. They
may be rich, but they are no gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your bowling team?&rdquo; demanded
Dale of the first student he met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down at the gym. I believe,&rdquo; drawled the
student, and walked leisurely away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wouldn&rsquo;t that freeze you stiff?&rdquo; cried
Andy. &ldquo;Say, for two pins I&rsquo;d turn around and
go back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Some felt as Andy did, yet the crowd leaped
to the campus and walked towards the gymnasium,
located some distance away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi!&rdquo; yelled a gardener, who was fixing
up a flower bed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t walk on this grass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can,&rdquo; answered Pepper coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! It&rsquo;s against the rules,&rdquo; insisted the
gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Will you kindly
point out the way we can walk?&rdquo; he added, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep to the paths. This grass is only to look
at, not to walk on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you told us,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;I might
have picked a blade for my buttonhole. Andy,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at the grass plot sideways,
you may be taxed for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd hurried over to the gymnasium.
There they found the Pornell students assembled.
All the best seats facing the bowling alleys
were filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got here, eh?&rdquo; said Roy Bock,
with no show of cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Dale, shortly. &ldquo;Where are
the seats you promised us, Bock?&rdquo; he added,
rather sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I guess you&rsquo;ll find them somewheres.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;You promised us half the room here, and we
want it,&rdquo; put in Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have always had half of our grandstand,
at baseball and football,&rdquo; put in Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take what seats you can get,&rdquo;
said Grimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; answered Dale, the sharpness in
his voice increasing. &ldquo;We are young gentlemen,
and we came here expecting to be treated as
such. Either we get half the best seats, or we
don&rsquo;t bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bowl?&rdquo; cried Roy Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the plain truth av it,&rdquo; cried
Hogan. &ldquo;We came over to play wid gintlemen,
not wid hogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call me a hog!&rdquo; cried Bock, in
a rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; if the boot fits yez can wear it,&rdquo; answered
the Irish cadet coolly. &ldquo;Me own opinion
is that ye are afraid to mate us fer fear av losing
the match, an&rsquo; so yez want to git us mad an&rsquo;
dhrive us home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s the size of it,&rdquo; said Bart Conners.
&ldquo;They know we can walk all over them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>A rather heated discussion followed, but Dale
and his men insisted that they would not play
unless given half the seats in the place and at
last Roy Bock and his followers had to give in.
Some who had seats had to give them up and
they started to hiss the Putnam Hall cadets in
consequence. But then Doctor Pornell appeared
on the scene and quietness was speedily restored.</p>
<p>As already told, the team representing Putnam
Hall was made up of Dale, Andy, Stuffer,
Hogan and Conners. The Pornell Academy
team was composed of Bock, Grimes, Sedley,
Carey and a tall, heavy-set youth named Noddingham.
It may be remarked that Noddingham
was an expert bowler and had helped to win
many matches. Bock relied on him to make a
big run and turn the score in favor of their side.</p>
<p>The match was to consist of two or three
games and the side winning two games was to
be the victor. Of course if one side won both
the first and second games, a third game would
not be necessary.</p>
<p>Dale and Bock were the first to bowl in the
initial frame. The Pornell student was perfectly
familiar with the alleys and was fortunate
enough to make a strike on the first ball bowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! that&rsquo;s the way to do it, Bock,&rdquo; was
the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up and you&rsquo;ll get three hundred!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>On his first ball Dale got six and on his second
he knocked down two more, netting a total
of eight. The Putnam Hall boys cheered at this,
but not very loudly. Then Andy followed with a
spare, and Grimes did the same. When Noddingham
came up he got a strike, and once more
the Pornell boys cheered lustily.</p>
<p>After that the game became pretty well
&ldquo;mixed.&rdquo; The Putnam Hall cadets managed to
get several spares in the seventh and eighth
frames, and likewise two strikes and these helped
somewhat. But Noddingham was there with
four strikes, and Grimes and Carey had several
spares, and as a result when the first game came
to a close the score stood, Pornell 834, Putnam
Hall 789.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Pornell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putnam Hall wasn&rsquo;t in it for a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told you we could beat them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the cheering was loud and long, while
many waved their caps and handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;ve got to take a brace,&rdquo; whispered
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have insisted on some practice on
the alleys,&rdquo; answered Stuffer. &ldquo;Three trial balls
was not enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>The second game was soon started and now
the Putnam Hall boys began to score a little better.
But so did the Pornell team, and during
the sixth, seventh and eighth frames it was nip
and tuck. But in the ninth Dale got a strike and
so did Hogan, while the others got spares, and
in the tenth Hogan added another spare and
Dale got a strike. On the other side Noddingham,
with a spare in the ninth, dropped to but
seven in the tenth frame, and only one player
got a strike.</p>
<p>Score in the second game, Putnam Hall 918,
Pornell Academy 862.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time we did it!&rdquo; cried Pepper enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up, boys!&rdquo; shouted Jack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got &rsquo;em on the run now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but strikes and spares now, nothing
but strikes and spares!&rdquo; yelled Harry Blossom.</p>
<p>The Pornell Academy boys looked very glum,
but they revived with the opening of the third
game, when two of their side made strikes and
one a spare. The Putnam Hall team did not
do so well, but Dale covered a difficult &ldquo;bridge&rdquo;
that won him loud applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a bridge wan man in a hundred
couldn&rsquo;t make,&rdquo; was Emerald&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas foin, so &rsquo;twas!&rdquo; And he slapped Dale
heartily on the back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Both teams were now on their mettle and
bowled with great care. Bock was very swift
in his movements and twice Andy caught him
overstepping the mark when delivering his ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Bock, we want none of that,&rdquo; he said to
the Pornell player.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Bock, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You overstep the mark when you run. You
keep back, or I&rsquo;ll claim a foul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t overstep the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added Bart Conners. &ldquo;I saw it as
plain as day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Maybe I did go over an eighth of
an inch,&rdquo; sneered Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went over half a foot,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play fair!&rdquo; shouted a score of Putnam Hall
students. &ldquo;Everybody watch the foul line!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that Roy Bock did not dare to overstep
the line. As a consequence his delivery was not
so good, and his score dropped behind a dozen
points or more.</p>
<p>At last the two teams reached the ninth frame.
Pornell was leading by seventeen points. They
got two spares, one made by Carey and the other
by Noddingham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your very best, fellows!&rdquo; cried Jack, to
his friends, and they bowled with such care and
swiftness that they got three strikes and two
spares.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, it&rsquo;s almost a tie!&rdquo; cried Harry Blossom.
&ldquo;Go in and win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make every ball count now, fellows!&rdquo; yelled
Pepper. He was so excited he could not keep his
seat.</p>
<p>Everybody was talking or cheering and the
din was terrific. In the midst of the excitement
the Pornell students made one spare and a seven,
two eights and a nine. Putnam Hall came to the
front with two strikes and two spares. Then
the extra balls were speedily bowled.</p>
<p>Score of third game, Putnam Hall 1042, Pornell
Academy 982.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Putnam Hall wins the match!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that last frame great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a wild cheering ensued, in the midst of
which the cadets from the Hall surrounded the
victors and shook hands over and over again. It
was certainly a moment of great triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you, boys,&rdquo; said George Strong.
&ldquo;You did very well indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; came suddenly from Roy Bock, as
he climbed up on a bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked several, pausing
in the midst of the general excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I claim a foul. Putnam Hall did not win
that last game fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Bock?&rdquo; demanded Dale,
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you did not win the game fairly,&rdquo; repeated
the Pornell student stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did win it fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain yourself, Bock!&rdquo; called out several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will. In the ninth and tenth frames three
of their bowlers overstepped the foul line. I
saw them do it, and so did Carey, Gussic and
Grimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That charge is absolutely false,&rdquo; cried Andy.
&ldquo;I for one did not come within three inches of
the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor did I,&rdquo; added Stuffer, and the others of
the team said practically the same thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very unfortunate,&rdquo; said George
Strong. &ldquo;You should have had an umpire for
the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was watching the line,&rdquo; said a Putnam Hall
student named Barton. &ldquo;I saw none of our
bowlers overstep the mark. But the Pornell men
went over&mdash;until Andy and the others protested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say they did go over,&rdquo; insisted Roy Bock.
&ldquo;You may call this match yours, but I&rsquo;ll not give
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Carey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; answered Dale, with a shrug
of his shoulders. &ldquo;We won it, and did so fairly,
and that is all there is to it,&rdquo; and turning on his
heel he walked off.</p>
<p>In the meantime Pepper had gone outside to
the carryall. Now he came around to a back
door of the Pornell gymnasium carrying the box
he had brought along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me, Jack!&rdquo; he called to his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A surprise for the Pornell boys. I was sure
they&rsquo;d treat us meanly, so I planned to get
square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great caution the two cadets took the box
to a corner of the building and opened it. Then
they took the contents up to a small gallery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, let &rsquo;em go!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and
Jack obeyed the command.</p>
<p>Soon around the gymnasium half a dozen big
black crows were flying. Caw! caw! caw! they
cried in their bewilderment.</p>
<p>And as they flew around each crow dropped
some cards which had been loosely attached to its
wings.</p>
<p>And the cards read:</p>
<p class="center"><i>We are to be eaten by the Pornell Bowling Team.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">FUN WITH PELEG SNUGGERS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crows, I declare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are dropping cards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is the limit, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, Pornell has got to eat crow to-day!&rdquo;
cried one Putnam Hall cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added another. &ldquo;Hope they
enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trick Pepper had played made all the cadets
laugh loudly. As for the Pornell students
they looked dark and sour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an outrage!&rdquo; stormed Roy Bock.
&ldquo;Eat crow indeed! I say we didn&rsquo;t lose the
match. They didn&rsquo;t play fair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;We did play fair&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the end of it,&rdquo;
answered Dale, and walked towards the carryall.
Others followed, and soon all the Putnam cadets
were ready to depart. Some bitter things were
said on both sides, and several of the rivals came
close to getting into a pitched battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have no fighting,&rdquo; said George Strong.
&ldquo;Come, we will depart at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we won fairly, Mr. Strong,&rdquo; pleaded
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure you did, Blackmore, and I give
Doctor Pornell no credit for allowing his scholars
to treat you in this style. But I want you
to act as young gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the carryall, the carriages, and the
cadets on bicycles were on their way. The bowling
team was in the carryall and with them were
Jack, Pepper and a number of others. Mr.
Strong was in one of the carriages ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, I think they were too mean for
anything!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;I wish I had punched
that Roy Bock&rsquo;s head for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Grimes ought to be thrashed, too,&rdquo;
added Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed that Fred Century kept rather
quiet,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he liked the
way Bock acted. When Bock claimed a foul he
looked bored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s as nice a fellow as there is at that
Academy,&rdquo; was Stuffer&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Say, anybody
bring any fruit along?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
half starved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was there ever a time when you weren&rsquo;t half
starved?&rdquo; asked Jack, grinning. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something
I brought for your especial benefit,&rdquo; and he
handed out an orange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! You have saved my life!&rdquo; And
Stuffer began to eat the fruit with great gusto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a sneaking idea they might provide a
little lunch,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I think Captain Putnam
would have done so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; Docther Pornell is too mean to do
that same,&rdquo; answered Hogan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been tould
he&rsquo;s only liberal whin there&rsquo;s money to be made
by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way of some would-be high-toned
folks,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know about those crows,&rdquo; came
from Harry Blossom. &ldquo;Where did they come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper set them loose&mdash;I saw him do it&mdash;he
and Jack,&rdquo; answered Bart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to own up that I&rsquo;m responsible,&rdquo; said
the Imp, with a broad smile. &ldquo;I took the crows
along because I felt almost sure Bock&rsquo;s crowd
would do something dirty&mdash;I know Bock so
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did you get the crows?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking with a young farmer one day
and he told me how he had been trapping crows
in his cornfield. As soon as this match was arranged
I got the farmer to catch the crows and
boxed &rsquo;em up. Then I wrote out the cards and
fastened them on the crows&rsquo; wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening the Putnam Hall cadets had a
little celebration on the campus in honor of the
victory. In this Ritter, Coulter and Paxton took
no part, but all the other students did and they
had a jolly time. Pepper and some others captured
Peleg Snuggers and told him he had to
make a speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nuthing about no speech,&rdquo; said
the general utility man. &ldquo;You better let me go&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
got some work to do down to the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to tell us about your experience
as a soldier,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was a soldier&mdash;I was a fireman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Tell us how
you became a fireman, and rescued four live kittens
from a ten-story burning building, Peleg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t rescue no kittens. But once I rescued&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A three-legged bedstead,&rdquo; finished Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken-backed clothes horse,&rdquo; suggested
Dale. &ldquo;Did the horse get over it, Peleg?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now see here, I didn&rsquo;t say nuthing about a
hoss. When I was a member o&rsquo; the Cowtown
Volunteer Fire Company, Mr. Glasby&rsquo;s house
burnt down, and I saved&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two pair of overalls and a box of gumdrops,&rdquo;
finished Pepper. &ldquo;Very brave, Peleg, very brave!
It&rsquo;s a wonder they didn&rsquo;t give you a tin medal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t no overalls nor no gumdrops
nuther,&rdquo; cried the general utility man. &ldquo;I
saved&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady and her sixteen small children!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jack. &ldquo;Hurrah for Peleg Snuggers, the
fireman-hero of Cowtown! Peleg, they ought to
erect a monument in the public square in your
honor for such heroic endeavors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, look a-here,&rdquo; gasped Snuggers. &ldquo;If you
want to hear what I saved&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do! We do!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;Tell us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really dying to know!&rdquo; simpered Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s meself that can&rsquo;t wait a minit longer,
Peleg, me brave b&rsquo;y!&rdquo; sighed Emerald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saved a sick dog,&rdquo; yelled the general utility
man, in desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peleg, that&rsquo;s one on us right enough!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was a valuable dog&mdash;wuth two hundred
dollars,&rdquo; explained the general utility man. &ldquo;He
was up on the second floor. I brung him down
on the ladder. We tumbled half the way, but it
didn&rsquo;t hurt the dog none, &rsquo;though it did skin my
nose. Mr. Glasby give me five dollars fer a-doin&rsquo;
of it,&rdquo; added Peleg, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, for skinning your nose?&rdquo; questioned
Jack, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, fer savin&rsquo; the dog from the fiery elements&mdash;thet&rsquo;s
wot Mr. Glasby called &rsquo;em&mdash;&rsquo;though
I didn&rsquo;t see no elements&mdash;it was jest a
big, red-hot fire,&rdquo; added the general utility man,
and then, watching his chance, he slipped away
and kept out of sight for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>During the past Summer and that Spring the
bicycling craze, as it was called, had struck Putnam
Hall hard, and now fully twenty of the
cadets had wheels. As a consequence a number
of the lads organized the Putnam Hall Bicycle
Club. Every lad who had a wheel was eligible
to membership, and our friends were not long in
joining. Ritter was a member and Coulter and
Paxton also joined. Bart Conners was the
leader of the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we get up a long distance race,&rdquo; said
Bart, one day. &ldquo;We have had several small contests,
but a race of fifteen or twenty miles would
show just what the fellows can do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>His proposal interested some of the cadets at
once. Of course there were many who did not
feel they could ride in a race that was so long,
but Pepper, Jack and Andy went in and so did
Ritter, Coulter and Paxton. Bart, of course,
entered, and six others followed.</p>
<p>It took a little study to lay out the course, but
at last this was accomplished, and the time of
the race was set for a Wednesday afternoon a
week later, Captain Putnam agreeing to close the
school an hour earlier than usual, if the weather
was right for the contest.</p>
<p>Reff Ritter was a good bicyclist, and as soon
as the race was assured he went around trying to
make wagers on the outcome of the contest. The
majority of the cadets would not bet&mdash;it being
against their principles, nevertheless the bully
found some willing to put up their money, and
he staked all he had&mdash;thirty dollars&mdash;on his
chance of winning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are so sure of winning there isn&rsquo;t much
use of our going in the contest,&rdquo; said Paxton to
Ritter, as he and the bully and Coulter met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am bound to win,&rdquo; answered Ritter.
&ldquo;I think you can help me to do it, too. You&rsquo;d
like to see me beat Ruddy and Ditmore and
Snow, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much!&rdquo; answered Coulter, with emphasis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here is the chance. And another thing&mdash;what&rsquo;s
the matter with your betting that Ruddy,
Ditmore and Snow will lose? Then, if they
do lose, you&rsquo;ll stand to win something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may win,&rdquo; said Paxton, who was
rather cautious when it came to putting up his
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ll tell you I haven&rsquo;t a dollar to
spare,&rdquo; added Coulter, who was the poorest of the
three. On more than one occasion he had borrowed
spending money from Ritter and Dan
Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan,&rdquo; answered Ritter. &ldquo;Come
on out on the lake in a rowboat. Then we&rsquo;ll
be sure that nobody will overhear us,&rdquo; and he led
the way to where the rowboats were tied up.
Ever since the scare over the use of the French
headache powder Ritter had been more or less
nervous and afraid of exposure.</p>
<p>All unconscious of any plot being hatched out
to make them lose the bicycle contest, Jack, Pepper
and Andy spent their spare time in exercising
on their wheels. A prize of a fine story book
had been put up by the club for the winner, and
all three were determined to do what they could
to come in ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of us must win,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care who it is. But I do want to see Ritter and
his cronies defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say!&rdquo; declared Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Same here!&rdquo; added Andy. &ldquo;The way Ritter
goes around blowing makes me sick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Brag is a good horse, but Win-out is
it,&rdquo; declared Jack.</p>
<p>Fortunately the roads in the vicinity of Putnam
Hall had been rolled in the Spring and were,
consequently, in good condition. The route laid
out took in two small hamlets and also passed
Point View Lodge, the Summer residence of a
rich gentleman named Rossmore Ford. The boys
were fairly well acquainted with Mr. Ford and
his family, and they had on two occasions done
the Ford girls, Laura and Flossie, great service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say if we stop at the Lodge and
pay our respects?&rdquo; said Jack one afternoon, as
he and his chums reached that neighborhood on
their bicycles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;I saw
Laura Ford in Cedarville not long ago and she
wanted to know why we hadn&rsquo;t been up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he never said a word about it!&rdquo; cried
Andy. &ldquo;Say, Pepper, did you want to call alone?
I knew you were sweet on those girls, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quit it, Andy. I was going to mention it,
but it slipped my mind, really it did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he was afraid we&rsquo;d meet another tiger
up here if we came,&rdquo; suggested Jack. &ldquo;Say, we
had a lively time nailing that beast, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;No more
runaway circus tigers for me,&rdquo; he added, with a
grave shake of his head.</p>
<p>The boys were less than half a mile from Point
View Lodge and it did not take them long to
wheel that distance. Then, leaning their bicycles
against some trees, they walked up the piazza and
rang the bell. A servant answered the summons,
and led them into the wide and cool hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rossmore has gone out,&rdquo; she announced
a minute later. &ldquo;But the young ladies will be
here shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how do you do!&rdquo; came a cry an instant
later, and Laura Ford rushed down the broad
stairs, followed by her sister. A warm handshaking
followed, and then the girls asked the
cadets all about how they had been, and invited
them to come out on the lawn and have a game
of croquet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERY OF A BRACELET</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We have been wondering why you didn&rsquo;t
come and pay us a visit,&rdquo; said Flossie, tossing
back her curly hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, we have been very busy with
our studies,&rdquo; answered Pepper, before his chums
could speak. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been thinking about coming,
I can assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard down in Cedarville that you had a
bowling contest with the Pornell Academy team,&rdquo;
said Laura. &ldquo;I understand that you won.&rdquo; And
she smiled brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t in that,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;But Andy
was, and he made a fine score, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the other fellows did as well as I did,&rdquo;
said the acrobatic youth, modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you beat the Pornell boys,&rdquo; exclaimed
Flossie. &ldquo;Do you know, I think some
of them too horrid for anything!&rdquo; And she drew
down the corners of her pretty mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we remember Roy Bock and his
crowd,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;I trust they haven&rsquo;t
annoyed you lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the most of them keep their distance
now,&rdquo; said Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flossie has had trouble with one of the boys,&rdquo;
went on Laura. She turned to her sister. &ldquo;Shall
I tell them about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; murmured Flossie,
and blushed deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they can help you to get it back,&rdquo; continued
the sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get what back?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flossie&rsquo;s bracelet. Have you ever met a Pornell
student named Will Carey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came from Jack and Pepper simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has Flossie&rsquo;s bracelet&mdash;one papa gave her
last Christmas. He called here once and when
they were fooling on this croquet lawn he took
the bracelet away from her and carried it off.
Ever since that time she has been trying to get
it back, but he won&rsquo;t bring it or send it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mean fellow!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Of course
he isn&rsquo;t base enough to steal the bracelet, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think that,&rdquo; spoke up Flossie. &ldquo;I
guess he is just trying to tease me. Once he
said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off short and blushed
deeper than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d give it back for a kiss,&rdquo; finished
Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I said I&rsquo;d rather box his ears!&rdquo; cried
Flossie, &ldquo;and I would, too! Oh, I wish I had
that bracelet back! I&rsquo;d never speak to him
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly is no gentleman to keep the
bracelet when you want it back,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;You ought to send a constable after
him, or something like that,&mdash;just to scare him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo; cried the girl who had
lost the jewelry. &ldquo;Papa would be very angry, I
am sure, if he found out I had allowed the bracelet
to go out of my possession, and mamma
wouldn&rsquo;t like it either. No, I&rsquo;d like to get it back
as quietly as possible, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we could get it back for you?&rdquo;
mused Jack. &ldquo;We might try it, anyway, if you
say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you could?&rdquo; questioned the
girl, brightening up. &ldquo;Oh, if you could I&rsquo;d be
so thankful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us try it anyway,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will go at it quietly?&rdquo; pleaded Flossie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, nobody shall know of it but Carey himself,&rdquo;
answered the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acted real nice first,&rdquo; explained the girl.
&ldquo;But the second time he called I saw he was of
the Roy Bock stamp and I treated him real cool.
I was very foolish to let him call at all. I cannot
bear such rude boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets remained to play several games of
croquet, and to partake of some lemonade and
cake. They told the girls about the proposed
bicycle race, and the latter said they would be
on the watch to see the contestants pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have cold milk or lemonade ready for
you,&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;So if you want to drink it
won&rsquo;t take you long to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks awfully!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;That will
be fine. I guess we&rsquo;ll be pretty dry after climbing
the hill below here, especially if the road is
dusty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way back to Putnam Hall the three
chums discussed the question of getting back
Flossie&rsquo;s bracelet. They had learned that the
bracelet was of solid gold, with five small diamonds
set in a row. It had cost at least a hundred
dollars, if not more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that rascal really means to keep the bracelet
he ought to be horsewhipped for it!&rdquo; declared
Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is only teasing Flossie,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;But he has no business to do that. She
is terribly worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea of Will Carey wanting to kiss her!&rdquo;
said Pepper, almost savagely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to&mdash;to&mdash;thrash
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll write Carey a letter, asking him to
meet me in Cedarville,&rdquo; said Jack, after thinking
it over. &ldquo;When he comes I&rsquo;ll tell him he must
return the bracelet at once, or take the consequence,
and I&rsquo;ll hint at the law. Most likely
that will fetch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want us along?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it may be better if I met Carey alone,
Pep. If all of us got at him he might get stubborn,
thinking we wanted to have the laugh on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he doesn&rsquo;t give up, we&rsquo;ll all get after
him, and good and hard, too,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>Jack wrote the letter to the Pornell Academy
student that evening. It was short and to the
point, and informed Carey that he must meet
the young major without fail. He was told to
come alone, and was informed that Jack would
also be unaccompanied. The next day brought a
brief answer, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do not know what you want, but will be
there.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Will Carey.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be astonished when you tell him what
brought you,&rdquo; said Pepper, when the young
major showed him the communication.</p>
<p>There was a small village green in Cedarville,
with a number of benches and a bandstand, and
Jack had requested Carey to meet him there.
The young major was on time, but he found the
Pornell student ahead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want that is so mysterious?&rdquo;
demanded Carey, abruptly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
much time. I&rsquo;ve got another engagement inside
of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve got to say, Carey, won&rsquo;t take an
hour,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;In fact, it won&rsquo;t take
me five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;let&rsquo;s have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a bracelet belonging to Flossie
Ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this announcement Will Carey was startled
and showed it. He gazed at the young major
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; he asked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did&mdash;and she wants it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Did she send you to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I volunteered to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to worry me into doing something, I
suppose,&rdquo; and the Pornell Academy student tried
to put a sneer into his tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;I simply want you to give the bracelet back,
that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;ve got to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did give the bracelet back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did! To-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, two or three weeks ago. I didn&rsquo;t want
her old bracelet. I simply took it to tease her,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave the bracelet back two or three
weeks ago?&rdquo; said Jack, slowly. &ldquo;She told me
yesterday that you still had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so! I returned it to her three or four
days after I took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you send it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t send it. I put it in a box of chocolates
and gave it to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer she didn&rsquo;t say anything about that,&rdquo;
mused Jack. Carey&rsquo;s statement mystified him a
good deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all you wanted to see me about?&rdquo; demanded
the Pornell youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be going,&rdquo; and without another
word Will Carey walked away across the green
and down the street leading to the steamboat
landing. Jack made as if to follow him, then
changed his mind and turned in the direction of
Putnam Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is a mistake somewhere,&rdquo; he told his
chums. &ldquo;I guess I had better see Flossie Ford
again before I go further in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might write her a letter,&rdquo; suggested Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Ford might not like us to be sending her
daughters letters, Pep. No, I&rsquo;ll talk it over, the
first chance I get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chance came sooner than expected. The
chums were out on Monday practicing for the
bicycle race when they saw a buggy ahead of
them. They spurted up, intending to pass the
vehicle, when they discovered that it contained
the Ford girls, who had been down to the Cedarville
post-office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad we met you,&rdquo; said Jack, when the greetings
were over. &ldquo;Please stop, I want to ask you
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when all had come to a halt by the road-side,
he told the particulars of his meeting with
Will Carey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never returned that bracelet at all!&rdquo; cried
Flossie, indignantly. &ldquo;He said it was in the box
of chocolates&mdash;if he hadn&rsquo;t said that I never
should have taken the box&mdash;but when I opened it
all there was in it were the candies and a note
asking me to meet him for a row on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are positive it wasn&rsquo;t in the box?&rdquo; asked
Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. I dumped all the chocolates into
my lap, for I wanted my bracelet and not the
candy. When I saw that he had fooled me I was
so angry I threw the chocolates away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he there at the time?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he went away just as soon as he gave me
the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go rowing, I suppose,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! I tore up the note and didn&rsquo;t answer
it. Then I didn&rsquo;t see him for a week. When
I did I asked for the bracelet, and he began to
tease me and said he had put it in the box of
chocolates, under the tissue paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are perfectly positive it wasn&rsquo;t in
the box?&rdquo; insisted Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack, don&rsquo;t you believe me?&rdquo; asked
Flossie, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I want to make certain there was no
mistake. You looked through the box carefully?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely did. All that was in it besides the
candy was a sheet of tissue paper and a tiny tin
tongs. Oh, I am positive the bracelet was not
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must confess I don&rsquo;t know what there
is to do,&rdquo; said Jack, biting his lip meditatively.
&ldquo;He declares he gave the bracelet back. Even if
you went to law, his word would be as good as
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are not going to law!&rdquo; cried Laura,
horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. But I don&rsquo;t see how you are
going to get the bracelet back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan,&rdquo; put in Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo; asked Flossie, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll mention it just now. I&rsquo;ll
tell you about it later,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But you
can rest assured of one thing. If Will Carey has
got that bracelet we&rsquo;ll get it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what Pep&rsquo;s plan is,&rdquo; broke in
Andy. &ldquo;And if so, I think it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; and
he winked at his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust I get the bracelet soon,&rdquo; said Flossie,
soberly. &ldquo;Every day I am afraid papa or
mamma will ask me about it. And when they
do I won&rsquo;t know what to say! Oh, I wish I had
never met that horrid Will Carey!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">THE GREAT BICYCLE RACE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what is this plan of yours, Pep?&rdquo; questioned
Jack, on the way back to Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make Carey a prisoner somewhere and scare
him into giving up the bracelet,&rdquo; was the prompt
answer. &ldquo;I am sure we can do it, for I feel he
must be a coward at heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he will not be likely to have the bracelet
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; put in Andy. &ldquo;But we can fix
that by making him give up something else&mdash;his
watch, for instance,&mdash;to be exchanged for the
bracelet later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it could be done,&rdquo; mused Jack.
&ldquo;But it would be a ticklish proceeding, for he
might have us arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do it on the sly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would recognize us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we were masked. Hurrah, that is the
way to do it! We&rsquo;ll wear masks and gowns, and
scare him out of his wits&mdash;make him think the
Whitecaps or Klu Klux Klan are after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proposal suited everybody, and the three
boys decided to carry out their plan as soon after
the bicycle race as possible.</p>
<p>The day for the proposed race dawned cloudily
and up to noon the cadets were doubtful if
they would be able to go out&mdash;it looked so much
like rain. But by one o&rsquo;clock the sun was shining
brightly and their spirits revived.</p>
<p>Ten cadets who had wheels were sent out
ahead, to station themselves about two miles
apart on the course. They were to keep tally of
every rider and see to it that nothing was done
contrary to the rules laid down.</p>
<p>The contestants lined up in front of the Hall
in fine style. Then came a pistol shot, and off
they went in a manner that elicited much cheering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! May the best rider win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, boys, twenty miles is a long
distance to cover!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the cries ran on as the bicyclists sped down
the roadway, their safeties gleaming brightly in
the sunlight. Everybody was in fine condition,
and the race promised to prove a spirited one.
Each racer wore a blue sweater with the letters
P. H. on the breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Jack, Andy and Pepper started in a bunch, directly
after the leaders. Not far away were
Ritter, Coulter and Paxton. They kept close behind
our friends for all of a mile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they want us to set the pace for them,&rdquo;
cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can do it,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;Pump
up, fellows, we want to break some records to-day.&rdquo;
And he spurted ahead.</p>
<p>Jack and Pepper were not to be left behind,
and they speedily caught up to the acrobatic
youth. Than another mile was covered and they
passed the first of the guards along the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing well!&rdquo; shouted the guard, as he
waved his hand at them. &ldquo;Keep it up!&rdquo; And
then his voice was lost in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the others are coming up,&rdquo; said Jack
a minute later, and then came a flash of wheels
and Reff Ritter went past them at top speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter can&rsquo;t keep up that pace,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;If he tries it he&rsquo;ll wear himself out before he
covers ten miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here come some more,&rdquo; said Andy, and a few
seconds later Coulter and Paxton flashed past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The riders were now coming to a narrow part
of the road. On either side were low-hanging
trees, so the bicyclists were forced to keep almost
in the middle of the highway, to avoid the
branches. All in the race were now ahead of the
three chums, who were saving a good portion of
their strength for the last half of the run.</p>
<p>As Jack and his friends turned a curve in the
highway they saw Coulter and Paxton directly
ahead of them. The two contestants were side
by side and riding now in anything but racing
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear the track!&rdquo; sang out Andy, as he and
the others came closer.</p>
<p>Neither Paxton nor Coulter paid the slightest
attention to the call. They kept on as before, at
a pace of about six miles an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you, give us some room!&rdquo; cried Jack.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t block the road in this fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to race, race,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are racing,&rdquo; drawled Paxton, without increasing
his speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going to kill ourselves at the
start,&rdquo; added Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us pass,&rdquo; said Pepper, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can pass for all of me,&rdquo; answered Paxton.
&ldquo;I am not holding you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Coulter. &ldquo;Go ahead if you
want to&mdash;the road is wide enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that the trees are in the way,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;Now, either go on or steer aside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Are you running this race?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coulter and Paxton continued to keep to the
middle of the road and it was utterly impossible
for the others to pass them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a trick&mdash;to keep us in a pocket and
hold us back,&rdquo; muttered Jack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the meanest
thing I ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to bump into them and send them
flying,&rdquo; growled Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do that you&rsquo;ll be disqualified,&rdquo; said
Andy.</p>
<p>Paxton and Coulter now spurted up a little.
They did this just to pass the next guard in good
form. But as soon as the guard had been left
behind they dropped down to their six-mile-an-hour
gait once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t pass them we might as well give
up right now,&rdquo; declared Pepper. &ldquo;I declare, I
never felt so much like punching a fellow in my
life!&rdquo; he added, vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know a way out of this!&rdquo; cried Jack,
suddenly. &ldquo;Let me get a little ahead of you and
watch me closely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The others were willing to try anything and
dropped behind as the young major desired.
About an eighth of a mile more was covered and
they came to another turn, where the road ran
slightly down hill. Here the trees were thicker
than ever, so that to pass Coulter and Paxton
would have been utterly impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what Jack has up his sleeve,&rdquo; mused
Andy.</p>
<p>The question was speedily answered. As the
turn of the road was gained there appeared a
foot path between the trees, running parallel to
the highway and distance from it less than five
yards. Onto this foot path spun Jack, and Pepper
and Andy came directly after him. The
path was smooth and spongy and the bicycles
flew over it &ldquo;like greased lightning,&rdquo; as Jack said
afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! they are off the road!&rdquo; yelled Paxton,
looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are on the path!&rdquo; yelled Coulter.
&ldquo;Come, we mustn&rsquo;t let them get ahead of us!&rdquo;
And he pedalled forward with vigor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me and be quick!&rdquo; cried the young
major to his chums. &ldquo;This path comes out into
the road at the foot of the hill!&rdquo; And away he
sped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>It was a dangerous proceeding, for a jar of
any kind might throw them headlong into a tree
or a rock. But they were on their mettle, and
willing to take chances, and Andy and Pepper
stuck to Jack&rsquo;s trail like shadows. On and on
they went over the foot path, and out in the
roadway Coulter and Paxton did their best to
outdistance them and block their chances of winning
the race.</p>
<p>At last the bottom of the hill was less than a
hundred feet away. Jack saw a straight stretch
ahead of him and put on all power. Like an
arrow from a bow his wheel swept on and gained
the road well in advance of Coulter and Paxton.
Andy followed, with Pepper overlapping his
back tire by three inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ve got to catch them!&rdquo; screamed
Coulter, in a rage. &ldquo;Remember the narrow road
at Dunham&rsquo;s farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, set the pace and I&rsquo;ll keep up if I
can!&rdquo; cried Paxton.</p>
<p>Jack and his chums were fifty feet in the lead.
They watched Coulter and Paxton narrowly and
saw them trying to steal up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to let them pass us&mdash;they&rsquo;ll only
pocket us again,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they&rsquo;ll wear us out trying to keep
them back,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;I must say, they
ride well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t keep it up more than ten or twelve
miles,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;But they may make us lose,
nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Another guard was passed and then came a
new spurt by Coulter and Paxton. They had
almost reached Andy when there followed a
crash and a yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter is down!&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Paxton smashed into him!&rdquo; added
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It serves them right,&rdquo; came from Jack.
&ldquo;Now, boys, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll bother us any
more.&rdquo; And he was right. Coulter had a broken
handle bar and Paxton received a badly-skinned
shin, and the two misguided ones had to give up
the contest.</p>
<p>Free to do as they pleased, Jack and his chums
now set their own pace and four miles were
reeled off in quick but easy fashion. On the
way they met one other rider who had broken
down and given up, and they passed two more
who were almost winded. Then they came in
sight of several others. Reff Ritter was in the
lead of the bunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is the time for us to make good!&rdquo; cried
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;Everybody
for himself!&rdquo; and he commenced to spurt along
the level stretch before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The three chums had soon passed all but Reff
Ritter and Joe Nelson. Of these two, Ritter was
in the lead, with Joe clinging to him stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Joe!&rdquo; sang out Andy. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
think he could ride so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks less used up than anybody,&rdquo; declared
Andy.</p>
<p>It was now a fierce grind. They were on the
road leading to Point View Lodge and Jack and
his chums looked out eagerly for the Ford girls.
They were at the gateway, holding a pitcher of
lemonade and glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awfully sorry, but if we stop we may lose
the race!&rdquo; shouted Jack, slackening his speed a
bit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nip and tuck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; called both girls. &ldquo;Good
luck to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack passed on, followed by Ritter and Andy.
Pepper had dropped behind, for the awful pace
was beginning to tell on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have some of that lemonade,&rdquo; he
said, as he took a glass. &ldquo;My mouth is full of
cotton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Jack wins,&rdquo; declared Laura. &ldquo;He was
in the lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come some time and tell us all about it!&rdquo;
called Flossie, and then Pepper leaped into the
saddle again and made after the flying contestants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>On and on sped the leading ones, Jack in advance,
Ritter second, Andy third and Joe Nelson
fourth. Then Andy and Joe spurted and passed
Ritter. But the bully clung to them like grim
death, and thus another mile was left behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three miles more and it will be over,&rdquo; cried
Jack presently. &ldquo;Now to put in some of my best
licks!&rdquo; And he rode harder than ever. &ldquo;Good-bye,
Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t lose me!&rdquo; called out the acrobatic
youth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite all in yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a tremendous burst of speed on the
part of the young major and his chum and it
speedily carried them ahead. They reached a
down grade and descended with the speed of an
express train. Then they rushed over a small
bridge spanning a brook, and took a turn leading
to the lake road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; came a sudden cry from ahead.
&ldquo;Help! Robbers! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody calling for help!&rdquo; answered Andy.
&ldquo;It comes from yonder cottage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; ejaculated Jack. He could scarcely
credit his eyesight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows with the green masks and
green hoods!&rdquo; burst out the acrobatic youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they are holding a boy and robbing
him,&rdquo; came from Jack. &ldquo;Andy, we&rsquo;ve got to stop
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And leaping from his wheel he ran toward the
cottage, followed closely by his chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">AT THE CHETWOOD COTTAGE</span></h2>
<p>The cottage mentioned by Andy was located
about a hundred and fifty feet from the road. It
was set among some small trees, and a roadway
led to the front door. Along this roadway dashed
Jack and the acrobatic youth.</p>
<p>The boy who had uttered the cry for help was
a tall, thin lad, with a shock of black hair and
deep, black eyes. He was a cripple, walking with
a crutch, one leg being bent at the knee. He had
come out of the cottage hopping on his good limb
and flourishing his crutch menacingly at the two
individuals in the green masks and hoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up the wrench!&rdquo; cried one of the strange
individuals, shaking a barrel stave in the boy&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have it!&rdquo; shouted the second masked
person. &ldquo;We need it for opening the treasure
chest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;Go away, I tell
you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>As he spoke he swung the crutch around and
hit one of the masked men on the shoulder. At
this the fellow leaped back and uttered a wild
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; cried Jack, as he leaped from his
wheel. &ldquo;Let that boy alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! The police have arrived!&rdquo; cried the
second masked man, who was armed with a
small section of a garden hose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must vanish!&rdquo; cried the other masked fellow.
&ldquo;They want to put us in jail for a thousand
years!&rdquo; and he began to retreat towards the
woods behind the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, hold up!&rdquo; called out Andy, a sudden
thought flashing into his mind. &ldquo;I think I know
those chaps,&rdquo; he added to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have robbed our home!&rdquo; called out the
cripple. &ldquo;Please stop them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the two masked men were running
for the woods with all the speed at their
command. Jack and Andy rushed after them,
leaving their bicycles at the cottage door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by saying you think you
know those chaps?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember Mr. Strong&rsquo;s two crazy
relatives&mdash;Bart Callax and Paul Shaff? I believe
the masked fellows are the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;By jinks, I think you&rsquo;re right, Andy! But I
thought Mr. Strong had those relatives of his
cared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have broken away again&mdash;crazy
people have a way of running off, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, those rascals acted as if they were half
loony,&rdquo; was the young major&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>All this while the cadets were racing after the
two strange individuals, who were now crashing
along between the trees and bushes of the woods.
The men were fleet of foot, and slowly but surely
they drew out of sight of their pursuers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; panted Andy at last. &ldquo;After
such a ride as we&rsquo;ve had on our wheels I&rsquo;ve no
wind left for a foot race,&rdquo; and he came to a halt
and leaned heavily against a tree for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew for certain that the two rascals
were really those crazy men,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s comment,
as he, too, halted. &ldquo;That would clear up
the mystery of the hold-up you and Pepper experienced
the time the tire was punctured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can tell Mr. Strong about this, when
we get back to Putnam Hall. He can telegraph
to the folks who had the men in charge and learn
if they have escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Having rested, the chums retraced their steps
to the cottage. They had run into the woods the
best part of half a mile, and just before they
came in sight of the cottage they met the crippled boy,
who had walked after them as well as
his condition would permit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you catch them?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they ran too fast for us,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have caught them had it not been
that we were tired out from bicycle riding,&rdquo; explained
Andy. &ldquo;We were in a race. But I guess
that&rsquo;s all over now, eh, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is so far as we are concerned,&rdquo;
was the acrobatic youth&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw some boys on wheels ride past, just after
you came up,&rdquo; said the crippled youth. He
heaved a deep sigh. &ldquo;Wish you had caught those
two men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think they were crazy?&rdquo; asked
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure they were&mdash;crazy as loons. But I
didn&rsquo;t know that at first. You see I was alone&mdash;father
and mother went to Ithaca yesterday and
they won&rsquo;t be home till Saturday. Those men
came along just as I was locking up to go fishing
down to the lake. They came up quietly and
didn&rsquo;t speak until they were right behind me. I
can tell you they scared me pretty well with those
green masks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they do?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;At first they demanded that I get them some
dinner. I said I had very little in the house.
Then one of them said he&rsquo;d take some oysters on
toast and some baked liver. I thought he was
fooling, and that the two of &rsquo;em might be some
of my friends who had come to our house thinking
they could scare me while my folks were
away. Then they went inside and began to rummage
around and I told them to quit&mdash;that a joke
was a joke, but they were carrying it too far.
Then they took a vest from my father&rsquo;s trunk
and I got scared and pulled one of &rsquo;em back.
Then both of &rsquo;em knocked me down and one
pulled out a big butcher knife. Then I got scared
and ran outside. I saw you coming on your
wheels and I yelled like an Indian. I am very
thankful you came to help me,&rdquo; concluded the
crippled youth.</p>
<p>After that he told them his name was Nat
Chetwood and that his father owned a vineyard
and a small shop where baskets were made. He
said his parent had gone to Ithaca on business
and that his mother was off to pay a relative a
visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they steal anything of value?&rdquo; questioned
the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; answered Nat Chetwood.
&ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what my father
had in his trunk. All they took out of the house
was a small looking-glass, an empty inkwell, and
a big, tin wash-basin. But they threw the wash-basin
away when you came. I know they took
one of my father&rsquo;s vests, for the big man of the
two stuffed it under his coat. While they were
at the trunk one of &rsquo;em asked me to whistle Yankee
Doodle and said he&rsquo;d take me to the circus
next week. Oh, they were certainly crazy,&mdash;and
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry we didn&rsquo;t catch them,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to report this, and without delay,&rdquo;
and he looked at Jack, suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; returned the young major.
&ldquo;And maybe we&rsquo;ll come back soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had somebody to stay with me until
my folks get back,&rdquo; said the cripple, wistfully.
&ldquo;I hate to stay alone, for fear those fellows will
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get some neighbor?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any very-near neighbors. But
maybe I can get Jake Dengert. He works for
my father,&rdquo; added Nat Chetwood.</p>
<p>It was not long after this that Andy and Jack
left the cottage. They mounted their wheels and
rode slowly in the direction of Putnam Hall.
They had covered only a short distance when
they heard a well-known whistle behind them and
looking back beheld Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried the Imp. &ldquo;I thought you had
won the race!&rdquo; And his face showed his disappointment.
&ldquo;My handle bars got loose, that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s bringing me in so late,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a bit of an adventure,&rdquo; answered
Jack, and he and Andy related what had occurred.
Of course Pepper was intensely interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surely is no joke,&rdquo; said he, when the others
had finished. &ldquo;We can be thankful we got off so
easily that time we had the breakdown and those
fellows tackled us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I think of it,&rdquo; answered Andy.
&ldquo;One thing is sure, though, those men have got
to be rounded up and captured. Nobody will be
safe so long as they are at large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who won the race, I wonder,&rdquo; said Pepper,
as they drew close to the school grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one of the boys&mdash;I&rsquo;ll ask him,&rdquo; replied
the young major, and wheeled toward the
cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The race was won by Joe Nelson,&rdquo; said the
youth. &ldquo;He came in about quarter of a minute
ahead of Reff Ritter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Joe!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;I really
didn&rsquo;t think he could do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to know he beat Reff Ritter,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;Had Reff won we should never have
heard the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>The chums were soon in the midst of the
riders and their friends. Many wanted to know
how it was that Jack and Andy had dropped behind
so unexpectedly, but the latter gave evasive
answers, for they did not want the truth to become
known just yet. First of all they wanted
to talk matters over with George Strong and
learn what he might have to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton and Coulter came in quite broke up,&rdquo;
said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves them right,&rdquo; answered Andy promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say you three fellows knocked them
down on purpose and they are going to make a
formal complaint against you,&rdquo; added the other
cadet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">AN INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE STRONG</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Knocked &rsquo;em down!&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a whopper!&rdquo; added Pepper. &ldquo;Coulter
went down for some reason we don&rsquo;t know, and
Paxton ran into him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we were all ahead of them at the time,&rdquo;
put in Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know anything more than what
I heard,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had nothing at all to do with it?&rdquo; questioned
Harry Blossom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I can tell you something worth
knowing,&rdquo; said Jack, and related how Ritter&rsquo;s
cronies had tried to keep them in a &ldquo;pocket,&rdquo; as
it is termed, and how they had slipped out.
&ldquo;They are mad because of that I guess,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know they lost money on this race,&rdquo; said
Bart Conners. &ldquo;I just learned that they made
bets that either they or Ritter would win.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;To my mind, it is nothing but a put-up job,&rdquo;
said Andy flatly. &ldquo;They really bet on Ritter and
they plotted to hold us back, knowing we really
stood a good chance to come in ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But none of us reckoned on Joe,&rdquo; said Jack,
with a grin. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t begrudge him the victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a minute!&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>None of the chums did, for Joe was a prince
of good fellows, even though rather quiet and
studious. All went up to shake him by the hand
and congratulate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I did it myself,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I could win at the start, but after
I had gone a couple of miles I found that I was
in prime condition, and then I just let myself out,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter had retired, thoroughly disgusted with
the outcome of the race. Without loss of time
he sought out Paxton and Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve lost, and I&rsquo;ve got to hand over
every dollar I can scrape up,&rdquo; he said, uglily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t blame me,&rdquo; answered Coulter.
&ldquo;We did our best to keep the others back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t keep Joe Nelson back. He was at
the front nearly all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told us to keep Ruddy, Ditmore and
Snow back&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t say a word about Nelson,&rdquo;
growled Paxton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who imagined he&rsquo;d come in first? I
didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d last more than six or seven
miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your money is gone, so is mine,&rdquo; sighed
Coulter. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be about ten dollars in debt
in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in debt, too,&rdquo; added Paxton. &ldquo;And besides,
look at both of us,&rdquo; and he pointed to their
numerous scratches, now covered with court-plaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody said you were going to make a
complaint against Ruddy and his chums?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we were&mdash;when we thought one or another
of &rsquo;em would come in ahead,&rdquo; answered
Paxton. &ldquo;But as none of them won, what&rsquo;s the
use? We don&rsquo;t want to get into a row if we can&rsquo;t
gain anything by it. If one of &rsquo;em had won, we
might have raised a kick and had the winner disqualified&mdash;and
saved our cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they to blame at all?&rdquo; asked Ritter,
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but you needn&rsquo;t tell outsiders so,&rdquo; answered
Gus Coulter.</p>
<p>While this talk was going on Jack and Andy
sought out Mr. Strong. They found the assistant
teacher in one of the classrooms, marking
some lesson papers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Strong, we would like to speak to you
for a few minutes in private,&rdquo; said the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at your service, Major Ruddy,&rdquo; answered
George Strong, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to ask you about those insane men,&rdquo;
continued Jack. &ldquo;We hate to bring the matter
up, but something has happened of which we
think you should be informed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean my relatives, Mr. Shaff and Mr.
Callax?&rdquo; questioned George Strong, quickly, and
now he was all attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Are they in custody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. I left them in care of a relative
in Malone, in the upper part of this state. They
went to Malone, you know, after they left Ithaca.
The relative, a party named Spelterly, caught
them with ease, and he promised me to put them
in a private sanitarium. But why do you ask
about this? Have you seen or heard of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think we have, although we are not sure,&rdquo;
answered Jack, and then he and Andy told of
what had occurred at the Chetwood cottage and
when the bicycle had broken down. At the recital
George Strong shook his head slowly and sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks very much as if they were at large
again and up to their old tricks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have to look into it without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you go out to hunt the men up, won&rsquo;t you
let us go with you?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But I want to make certain they are
at large at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, those men ought to be rounded up, no
matter who they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. But if they are not Mr. Callax
and Mr. Shaff then I think I&rsquo;ll allow the regular
authorities to do the work,&rdquo; answered the
teacher.</p>
<p>The great bicycle race was the talk of Putnam
Hall for several days and Joe Nelson was warmly
congratulated over his victory. Pepper, Jack and
Andy waited for the proposed &ldquo;kick&rdquo; from Paxton
and Coulter, but it did not materialize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know better than to make such a complaint,&rdquo;
said Andy, at last. But Jack guessed
the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found out we didn&rsquo;t win,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so
a complaint wouldn&rsquo;t help them, so far as the
outcome of the contest is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had already turned his sloop over to the
shipbuilders to have the necessary repairs and alterations
made, and now received word that the
<i>Alice</i> would be ready for him on the following
Monday afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you can get ready for that race with the
<i>Ajax</i>,&rdquo; said Pepper, when he heard of this. &ldquo;I
hope you beat the Pornell craft all hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so myself, but I heard yesterday that
Fred Century had his boat in A1 condition and
was doing wonders with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll do wonders with the <i>Alice</i>, and
I know it,&rdquo; said Pepper encouragingly.</p>
<p>On Friday night Jack and Andy were called
into Mr. Strong&rsquo;s private room. The assistant
teacher looked much worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just received word from my relative
in Malone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It appears that Bart Callax
and Paul Shaff were confined in a private
sanitarium in Syracuse. But they escaped some
time ago, and though the keepers have hunted
everywhere for them they have not been found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the men in the green masks and hoods
must have been them,&rdquo; cried the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are right, Major Ruddy, and
it worries me greatly. I really do not know what
to do. I hate to make a public affair of this&mdash;especially
in view of what has occurred in the
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not start a private hunt for the two
men?&rdquo; suggested Andy. &ldquo;We are willing to do
all we can to aid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are and I am thankful to you for
it,&rdquo; said the teacher warmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow is Saturday,&rdquo; said the young
major. &ldquo;Why not organize a party and search
the woods back of the Chetwood home? We
may be able to get on the trail of the pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter was talked over for half an hour,
and in the end George Strong said he would go
out the next morning, and take Andy and Jack
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you take Pepper Ditmore, too, and
Stuffer&mdash;I mean Paul&mdash;Singleton?&rdquo; asked Jack.
&ldquo;I know they won&rsquo;t say a word to anybody, and
you may need them&mdash;if we find the men and
they show fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want no violence, Major Ruddy. I think
we made a mistake before by not treating Mr.
Callax and Mr. Shaff very gently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t treat a man gently if he wants to
club you,&rdquo; answered Andy bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, and we&rsquo;ll have to arm ourselves,
I suppose, in case of emergency.&rdquo; George Strong
mused for a moment. &ldquo;Yes, you may include
Ditmore and Singleton in the party&mdash;but tell
them to keep quiet about it. I do not wish this
affair to become the talk of the whole school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was arranged they should leave Putnam Hall
directly after breakfast. They would first visit
the Chetwood cottage and from that point endeavor
to trace the flight of the insane men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;They must be stopping somewhere,&rdquo; said the
teacher. &ldquo;Maybe they have some sort of hut in
the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they wanted that looking-glass to furnish
it with,&rdquo; added Andy and started to laugh,
but quickly subsided, for he did not want to give
George Strong pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a terrible thing to be out of one&rsquo;s head,&rdquo;
said the teacher. &ldquo;I can remember when both of
those men were as clear-minded as anybody. But
after they lost their money they seemed to let
their brains go with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is strange that they were both
affected,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is something I can hardly understand
myself,&rdquo; answered the teacher. &ldquo;Although
they are closely related and have the same blood
flowing in their veins.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">SEARCHING THE WOODS</span></h2>
<p>As the party did not know how long they
would be away, they took a lunch with them. A
number of the cadets were curious over their departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where they are bound?&rdquo; said Ritter
to his cronies. He met them at the end of the
campus, striding along at a rapid gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s one of Strong&rsquo;s object-lesson walks,
I guess,&rdquo; sneered Coulter. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll show them
how some plants grow, and get some specimens
of rocks, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! that&rsquo;s too dead slow for me,&rdquo;
drawled Ritter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather skin down to Dollon&rsquo;s
in town and play pool and have a smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Paxton. &ldquo;Only, I haven&rsquo;t
any money with which to pay for such fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard something at breakfast,&rdquo; went on Reff
Ritter, as the three cronies walked down to the
lake. &ldquo;Jack Ruddy is going to get his sloop back
soon, and he is going to arrange for a regular
race with that new Pornell boat, the <i>Ajax</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he loses,&rdquo; growled Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto here,&rdquo; joined in Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will lose&mdash;if I have anything to do with
it,&rdquo; continued Ritter in a whisper, so as not to be
overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; came from both of his
followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just this, and I have no hesitation
about telling you, for I expect you to stand by
me. It will be a chance to get back some of the
money we lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see your plan,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;You
want to fix it so Ruddy loses the race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, and I think it will be dead easy, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stand in with me if I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely we will,&rdquo; said Paxton. &ldquo;Of
course we don&rsquo;t want to do something and get
found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody will be found out. We can make
Ruddy lose, and if we lay some good bets on the
Pornell boat we can make all kinds of money&mdash;win
back what we lost and make a pile besides.&rdquo;
And then the three cronies went out on the lake,
to row and to talk over the plan that Reff Ritter
had in mind to carry out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;That bicycle race has made Ritter and his
crowd as sour as lemons,&rdquo; said Andy, as he and
Stuffer walked on behind the others, on the way
to the Chetwood cottage. &ldquo;Every time they pass
me they glare at me like wild animals. They
don&rsquo;t pretend to be the least bit civil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be on your guard, Andy. If
they have anything up their sleeve you want to be
ready for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they are down on Jack more than on
any of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he is major of the battalion, I
guess. Ritter said once that he thought there
ought to be a change of officers every month. I
reckon he wanted to carry a sword for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the cadets will ever elect him&mdash;he
hasn&rsquo;t friends enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he might be able to buy up some votes&mdash;among
the fellows who love to be taken out for
a good time. He has lots of spending money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. He lost about all he had, so I understand,
on the bicycle race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take the party headed by Mr. Strong
long to reach the Chetwood cottage. They found
the cripple there and also the working man, Jake
Dengert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;I expect my folks by noon,&rdquo; said Nat Chetwood.
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll find out if the men took anything
valuable from the trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you said they took a vest,&rdquo; said
George Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that wasn&rsquo;t of much account, although
it did belong to a suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cripple had seen nothing further of the
strange men and had no idea what had become
of the pair. The hired man had tramped out
into the woods for a short distance, but had been
unable to get on their trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll not find them either,&rdquo; said
George Strong, with a sigh. &ldquo;But we can try it
anyway.&rdquo; He did not deem it necessary just yet
to mention the fact that he thought the men
might be his relatives.</p>
<p>With the cadets beside him, the teacher struck
out into the woods, in the direction Jack and
Andy pointed out. They passed a fine spring
and stopped long enough for a drink. Then they
took to a trail that led up a small hill away from
the lake. On either side of the trail were trees
and dense brushwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they must have come along this trail&mdash;or
else they lost themselves in the woods,&rdquo; declared
the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a wonder they have not hopelessly lost
themselves before now,&rdquo; said the teacher. &ldquo;How
far is it from here to the spot where you met
them the day your bicycle broke down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be all of three miles,&rdquo; answered Andy,
and Pepper nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must keep more or less to the woods,&rdquo;
continued George Strong. &ldquo;Otherwise more
folks would see them and spread the alarm. I
asked that man at the cottage and he said he had
heard nobody mention them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have some hiding spot in the
woods, where they lay off their masks and
hoods,&rdquo; said Stuffer. &ldquo;They must fancy themselves
regular highwaymen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are my relatives, and I capture them,
I&rsquo;ll take good care that they do not get away
again,&rdquo; said George Strong.</p>
<p>The boys tramped on with the teacher until
all calculated they had covered fully a mile. Then
they came out of the woods at a point where a
babbling brook ran over some rocks. Here was
a good-sized clearing and at the farther end a
hut that had once been used by lumbermen or
charcoal burners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be in that hut!&rdquo; cried George
Strong. &ldquo;Let us spread out and surround the
building. Use no violence if it can possibly be
avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>They scattered as he advised, and approached
the lonely hut from all sides. The door stood wide
open and with great caution George Strong
looked inside. Much to his disappointment nobody
was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they have been here!&rdquo; cried Jack, as he
and his chums entered the dilapidated structure.
&ldquo;See, there are the remains of a fire and of a
roast chicken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been living on the contents of
some farmers&rsquo; hen-houses,&rdquo; murmured Pepper.
&ldquo;This looks as if they had been here last night if
not this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the looking-glass that was stolen,&rdquo;
cried Andy, pointing to the object, hanging on the
wall.</p>
<p>All searched the old hut with interest and came
across a collection of curious objects such as only
two crazy men would think of collecting. There
were several pots with the bottoms knocked out,
a tufted easy chair with the back gone, three
shoes for the right foot and none for the left, a
bundle of at least forty old neckties, several articles
about airships cut from Sunday newspapers,
a box of face powder, four hammers, three
plumb lines, a dictionary with the words beginning
with B and M cut out, and six broken ice
skates. Around one skate was a watch chain that
appeared to be of solid gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing of value,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;If
it is solid gold it ought to be worth forty or fifty
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly a very fine chain,&rdquo; answered
George Strong. &ldquo;And unless I am very much
mistaken, it belongs to Mr. Callax. It runs in my
mind that he used to wear just such a chain as
this. They once tried to take it away from him
for safe keeping, but he raised such a row they
let him keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;ll come back to this hut this
afternoon or to-night,&rdquo; suggested Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible. I hope they do,&rdquo; answered
the teacher.</p>
<p>They searched the woods until the middle of
the afternoon, stopping only long enough to eat
their lunch, which they washed down with a
drink from a spring. Then they went back to
the hut. Here it was arranged that Pepper,
Andy and Jack should go out to the other side of
the woods, while the teacher and Stuffer remained
at the hut, to await the possible coming
of the crazy men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>The three chums soon reached a portion of the
woods overlooking a fair-sized stream that
flowed into the lake. They were seeking for some
means of crossing the brook when Jack
suddenly pulled Andy and Pepper back into the
bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; whispered the Imp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just saw somebody standing on the other
side of the brook,&rdquo; answered the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the crazy men?&rdquo; queried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think it was somebody we wish very
much to meet&mdash;and in just such a place as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Carey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">THE BONE AND BLOOD CLUB</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;If it is Carey, and he is alone, we are in luck,&rdquo;
said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we want him to recognize us?&rdquo; asked
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as it will make much difference,&rdquo;
returned the young major, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Perhaps we can scare him better by disguising
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us make certain it is Carey first and that
he is alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked up the brook a short distance and
reached a bank that was several feet higher than
that opposite. From this point it was an easy
matter to clear the watercourse at a bound. Then
they hurried down in the direction of the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; whispered Jack, a few minutes
later, and pointed through the trees to where a
youth lay sprawled out on the seat of a small
rowboat. Beside him were the oars and some
fishing tackle and also a long pole which appeared
to have a drag-net attached to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is certainly alone,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;But he
may be waiting for somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the quicker we act the better,&rdquo; returned
Jack.</p>
<p>They decided to cut holes in their handkerchiefs
through which to see and then tie the articles
over their faces. Then they turned their
cadet coats inside out, and rubbed a little dust
on their necks and hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t recognize us very easily,&rdquo; said the
young major, &ldquo;especially if we disguise our
voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move Jack be made our general spokesman,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;He knows just what we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to get Flossie Ford&rsquo;s bracelet for
her, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Incidentally if we
can scare Carey half to death for annoying Flossie,
so much the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll scare him right enough,&rdquo; answered
Jack, grimly.</p>
<p>Will Carey was dozing away when of a sudden
he felt himself in the grasp of three strong pairs
of hands. In a twinkling he was turned over
and his hands were bound behind him with a
piece of his own fishing line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;Help!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, if you don&rsquo;t want to get hurt!&rdquo; was
the command, in a deep, rough voice, and now he
saw that his assailants were three masked persons.
They jerked him to his feet, made him
step ashore, and in a jiffy compelled him to
march a short distance into the thickest of the
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what do yo&mdash;you want of me?&rdquo; he
faltered. He was far from being brave and his
present predicament filled him with terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to behave yourself,&rdquo; was the
answer, delivered in the deep voice previously
employed by Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am behaving myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not, Will Carey. You have done
an innocent person a great wrong&mdash;and the Bone
and Blood Club of Cedarville is going to see to it
that you right that wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the&mdash;the Bone and Bone Club?&rdquo; faltered
the Pornell Academy student.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are some of the members of that club&mdash;chosen
to right this great wrong you have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hav&mdash;haven&rsquo;t done any wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have&mdash;do not dare to deny it&mdash;or the
vengeance of the Bone and Blood Club shall descend
upon your head like a fiery serpent and a
stroke of lightning,&rdquo; answered Jack, making his
voice as deep and menacing as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what have I done?&rdquo; asked Carey. He
was now shaking so he could scarcely speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have turned thief&mdash;yes, and you have
told lies. Is it not so, Brothers of the Worthy
Bone and Blood Club?&rdquo; asked Jack, turning to
his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so!&rdquo; exclaimed Andy and Pepper, nodding
slowly and solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Me?&rdquo; gasped Will Carey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what did I steal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took from one of the fairest maidens of
Cedarville a golden bracelet, and you have persistently
refused to return the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped the prisoner, and the others saw
him turn pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must return the bracelet,&rdquo; went on Jack.
&ldquo;Otherwise it will be our painful duty to chastise
you severely and then hand you over to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; shrieked the Pornell
Academy student. &ldquo;Let me go! Please let
me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you return the bracelet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I did return it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it in a box of chocolates and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;That story is absolutely false, prisoner. You
have the bracelet still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not,&rdquo; and Will Carey began to
tremble. &ldquo;Oh, please let me go, please do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the bracelet and must give it up,&rdquo;
continued Jack. He turned to his chums. &ldquo;Is
the fire burning well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is burning well, your Highness,&rdquo; answered
Andy and Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take the prisoner and warm him up.
He appears to be cold, for he is shivering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;you shan&rsquo;t put me against any fire
and blister me!&rdquo; yelled Will Carey, trembling
from head to foot. &ldquo;Oh, please let me go, please
do! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you all I&rsquo;m worth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want nothing but the bracelet you took,&rdquo;
answered Jack, firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that we must and shall have!&rdquo; came in
a deep chorus from the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t got the bracelet, I tell you,&rdquo; said
the prisoner, desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do with it&mdash;sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;I gave it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not give it back, and if you say so
again we&rsquo;ll put you on the fire to roast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy! Mercy!&rdquo; screamed the Pornell Academy
student and fell on his knees. He thought
he was in the hands of three rough persons who
would be only too willing to carry out the dire
threat made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done with that bracelet?&rdquo;
demanded Jack, again. &ldquo;Come, out with the
truth at once.&rdquo; And he raised a stick he had
picked up, as if to strike Carey to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit me! I&mdash;I lost the bracelet!&rdquo;
screamed Will Carey. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t hurt me,
please don&rsquo;t! I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I&mdash;I had the
bracelet in a blue tin box in my pocket and I
went for a ride on a sloop, and the wind knocked
the sloop over and the box dropped out of my
pocket. That&rsquo;s the honest truth, I give you my
word on it. I&rsquo;d give anything to get the bracelet
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dropped it out of your pocket while on
the lake,&rdquo; said Jack, with deep interest. &ldquo;Was
that the day the <i>Ajax</i> raced with the <i>Alice</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you hunted for the tin box since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen times. Why, I came out to-day
to look for it. The water is rather shallow
where the sloop went over, and I made a net
and dragged the bottom, but I couldn&rsquo;t find the
box or the bracelet. The net is in my boat now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The chums were now convinced that Will
Carey was telling the truth, for Jack and Pepper
well remembered how concerned Carey had been
over the loss of the blue tin box and how he had
not told what it contained. The presence of the
drag-net also added color to his tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you give Miss Ford her bracelet
long ago?&rdquo; demanded Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wanted to&mdash;to tease her a little, that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; answered the Pornell Academy student. &ldquo;I
wish I had given it to her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t find the bracelet, you&rsquo;ll have to
pay for it,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I know that, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t pay for it right away. My father
has cut me down&mdash;he says I am spending too
much foolishly,&mdash;and I lost a lot on a bowling
match we had with some Putnam Hall fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we heard something about that bowling
match,&rdquo; said Jack, not to let the prisoner get a
clue to his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! hullo!&rdquo; came a shout from a distance.
&ldquo;Where are you, Jack? Where are you, Pepper?
Hullo, Andy! Come this way, we have got on
the trail of those two crazy men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Stuffer burst into view and
came walking toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep back!&rdquo; shouted Jack, quickly. &ldquo;Keep
back and don&rsquo;t say anything. We&rsquo;ll soon be with
you.&rdquo; And then he whispered something to his
two chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you again soon, Carey,&rdquo; said the
young major, to the prisoner. &ldquo;In the meantime,
remember you must either find that bracelet
or pay for it,&rdquo; and so speaking he cut the line
that bound Carey&rsquo;s hands and rushed off in the
direction of Stuffer, followed by Andy and Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">THE END OF THE SEARCH</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo; demanded
Stuffer, as the party of four cadets turned in the
direction of the hut in the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve been playing a joke on a Pornell
Academy student,&rdquo; answered Jack, quickly. He
thought it best to keep the affair of the bracelet a
secret. All had taken the handkerchiefs from
their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that Will Carey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the crazy men?&rdquo; asked Pepper, to
change the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we walked out on a certain foot path
we discovered after you were gone and we found
a spot where they had been camping. One of
them had written a bit of doggerel on a sheet of
paper and tacked it to a tree. Mr. Strong says
it is in Callax&rsquo;s handwriting. In the doggerel he
bids farewell to this neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Strong think they have left?&rdquo; asked
Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know what to think. He wants to
follow the foot path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take the cadets long to reach the spot
where Stuffer had left George Strong. Then the
whole party hurried along the foot path, which
ran directly through the dense woods. Here the
ground was soft and they could see the fresh
footprints with ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe this leads to the lake,&rdquo; said the
teacher, and he was right. They soon came out
on the lake shore, at a point where there was
a tiny cove. Close at hand was a boat stake, and
they could plainly see where a boat had been tied
up and how it had been shoved off with an oar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have gone,&rdquo; said George Strong, and the
tone of his voice showed his disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is no telling where they have gone
to,&rdquo; added the young major.</p>
<p>They walked up and down the lake shore for a
good distance, but saw no craft containing two
men. Not far away was a small boat and this
contained Will Carey, who was rowing slowly in
the direction of the Pornell Academy dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to give this hunt up,&rdquo;
said the teacher, when it was about four o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon. &ldquo;Too bad! I thought sure
we&rsquo;d capture them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going back to the Chetwood cottage?&rdquo;
asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well&mdash;it is not far out of our
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they arrived at the cottage they found
that Mr. Chetwood and his wife had returned.
The man was looking anxiously for them to
appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git &rsquo;em?&rdquo; he cried, when he caught sight of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry&mdash;dreffully sorry,&rdquo; and Mr. Chetwood
heaved a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they stole a vest belonging to you,&rdquo;
said George Strong. &ldquo;Anything in it of value?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You see, I had
a roll of old Confederate money and I kept it in
the vest&mdash;why, I don&rsquo;t know. Well, the roll is
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of bills did it contain?&rdquo; questioned
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten and twenty dollar bills&mdash;about two hundred
dollars in all. But as they was Confederate
I reckon they ain&rsquo;t wuth ten or twenty cents now.
You see I was a Confederate soldier in the war&mdash;that&rsquo;s
how I got the bills,&rdquo; explained Mr. Chetwood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those men are crazy,&rdquo; said George Strong.
&ldquo;I may as well tell you they are distant relatives
of mine&mdash;although I am in no wise responsible
for their safe keeping. They have been in charge
of another relative, who put them in a sanitarium.
I suppose if they try to pass some of those Confederate
bills they&rsquo;ll get into more trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may lead to their capture&mdash;and that will
be something,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure was crazy&mdash;to steal the looking-glass
and the inkwell,&rdquo; said Mr. Chetwood. &ldquo;I
am glad they didn&rsquo;t harm Nat. Being a cripple,
he can&rsquo;t defend himself very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do all I can to capture them,&rdquo; said Mr.
Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to capture them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chetwood.
&ldquo;Why everybody will be afraid to stir
out&mdash;with two crazy men roaming the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secret could not be kept longer, and by
Sunday persons living for miles around knew
that the crazy men who had once before been in
that vicinity were again at large. A large number
of men and boys went out to hunt for the
pair, but without avail. George Strong offered
a reward of one hundred dollars for their capture,
but even this did not bring them to light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>As soon as the young major got his sloop back
from the boat builders he tried the craft and
found her in prime condition. The new mainsail
and the improved tiller worked wonders, to his
mind, and he took a keen delight in running the
<i>Alice</i> up and down the lake in front of Putnam
Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good deal better than she was,&rdquo; said
he to Pepper. &ldquo;I am not afraid to match her
against anything on this lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is saying a good deal, Jack,&rdquo; returned
his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I am talking about,&rdquo; was the
young major&rsquo;s confident answer.</p>
<p>During the week Jack met Fred Century, and
from the latter learned that the owner of a sloop
up the lake was also anxious for a race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Bob Anderson,&rdquo; said Century.
&ldquo;He owns a sloop named the <i>Neptune</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the boat,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Rather
a rakish-looking craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she is. Well, Anderson is very anxious
for a race, and I was wondering if we couldn&rsquo;t
make ours a three-handed affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing if you are,&rdquo; said Jack, promptly.
&ldquo;I am not afraid of anything on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then supposing we see Anderson and have
a talk with him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>A meeting was held, and the upshot of the
conference was that a race between the three
sloops was arranged for the following Saturday,
weather permitting. Some gentlemen from
the New York Yacht Club, who were stopping at
Ithaca, volunteered to judge the race and were
accepted by all interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now you&rsquo;ll have two sloops to beat,&rdquo;
said Dale to Jack after the race had been decided
upon. &ldquo;They tell me the <i>Neptune</i> is a splendid
craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dale, do you think they can beat the <i>Alice</i>?&rdquo;
demanded the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not. But you don&rsquo;t want to be too sure
of this race, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of the <i>Alice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Bob Anderson was well known in local society,
his coming into the race created quite a
stir. As a consequence the race became a social
affair, and hundreds of people said they would
attend. Many boathouses along the lake were to
be decorated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going out&mdash;in papa&rsquo;s yacht,&rdquo; said
Laura Ford to Andy when they chanced to meet
near the Hall one afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;But you
must be careful and not go overboard again&mdash;as
you did when we had the rowing races.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be very careful,&rdquo; answered the girl.
And then she gave Andy a warm look, for she
had not forgotten what a great service he and
his chums had done her and her sister on that
occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope we have a spanking breeze,&rdquo; said
Jack to Pepper, as they and Andy took a short
sail in the <i>Alice</i> on Friday afternoon. &ldquo;If there
is one thing I despise in a race it is a drifting
match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll get too much wind,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get too much for me&mdash;I know how to
handle my boat. She&rsquo;ll not go over with me, as
the <i>Ajax</i> did with Fred Century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Century think he can beat the <i>Neptune</i>?&rdquo;
asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a breeze, yes. But he told me the <i>Neptune</i>
was such a rakish sloop she could drift well
when the wind died down. So if we don&rsquo;t get
much wind Anderson&rsquo;s craft may win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure the boat is in the best possible condition,&rdquo;
went on Pepper, with a sharp look around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she look it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you, I&rsquo;d keep a close eye on my boat
until that race is sailed,&rdquo; said Andy, after a few
minutes of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know we&rsquo;ve got our enemies in
this school. Ritter and his crowd would rather
see you lose than win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton and Coulter certainly wanted us to
lose that bicycle race,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;d try to injure the boat?&rdquo;
asked the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought that I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d stay on board to-night,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you want a good night&rsquo;s sleep,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;One of us can stay on board as well as you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us both stay,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
be company for each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you can&rsquo;t get permission to stay?&rdquo;
said the owner of the <i>Alice</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t ask for permission,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just come down here after lights
are out and bunk till morning. Then we&rsquo;ll watch
our chance and slip back into the Hall some time
before breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was arranged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">SURPRISES OF A NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Ritter, Paxton and Coulter had arranged
their plans with care, and they were practically
certain that the <i>Alice</i> would lose the boat race.
As a consequence the three unworthies did not
hesitate to go around and lay wagers that either
the <i>Ajax</i> or the <i>Neptune</i> would win. As they
did not wish to bet openly against their own
school, so to speak, they made the most of their
wagers through a man in Cedarville named Crosby&mdash;a
fellow who kept a variety store, including
sporting goods and fishing tackle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make Jack Ruddy and his chums feel
sick, and rake in some good shekels in the bargain,&rdquo;
said Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be careful in our work,&rdquo; cautioned
Paxton. &ldquo;If we get caught there&rsquo;s no telling
what they&rsquo;ll do to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t croak before you&rsquo;re hurt, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to get caught?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not&mdash;and we won&rsquo;t be. This work
is to be done in the dark and while we are disguised.
At the first alarm we can skip. But I
don&rsquo;t look for any alarm,&rdquo; concluded Ritter.</p>
<p>It was well that Andy and Pepper pretended
to go to bed with the others, for Ritter and his
cohorts were on the watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you the coast would be clear,&rdquo; said
Ritter. &ldquo;All the same, I guess we had better lay
low until about midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly eleven when Andy and Pepper
arose, donned their clothing, and taking their
shoes in their hands, stole from the dormitory
and crept downstairs to a side door of the Hall.
Nobody saw them, and in a moment more they
were walking rapidly over the school grounds
in the direction of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be a fool&rsquo;s errand after all,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;But it is better than running the risk
of having somebody injure the sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have come armed,&rdquo; returned his
chum. &ldquo;Anybody who would injure a boat just
before a race ought to be shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll arm ourselves when we get down to
the boathouse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Reaching the building, they went inside and
procured some old hockey sticks that chanced to
be handy. Then they entered a rowboat at the
dock and poled over to the <i>Alice</i>. Clambering
aboard, they tied the rowboat to the stern. As
chance would have it, the gentle breeze that was
blowing sent the small craft around to the lake
side of the sloop, so the rowboat was not visible
from the shore.</p>
<p>The two cadets had put in rather a strenuous
day and were consequently sleepy. They wanted
to get what rest they could for the morrow and
so decided to watch by turns, two hours at a
stretch. It was a clear night, with countless stars
overhead, and the day for the great race promised
to be all that could be desired.</p>
<p>The <i>Alice</i> had a little cuddy, just large enough
to accommodate two, and into this the boys
crawled, to get out of the night air, which was
damp. Andy was the first to rest, while Pepper
sat up, his eyes trained on the dimly-lit shore.</p>
<p>An hour passed and the Imp was growing decidedly
sleepy. He scanned his watch closely by
the light of the stars and saw it was not yet time
to awaken his companion. Then he trained his
eyes on shore once more.</p>
<p>What was that, a dog or a person, crawling
steadily forward from behind the trees which
lined that side of the campus? He sat up and
peered forth eagerly. Then another figure appeared
and soon a third. They were coming
straight for the boathouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something doing,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Wonder if I
had better call Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He decided to wait. The three figures came
closer and soon stood beside the boathouse. He
now saw that they were three persons wearing
black gowns and black hoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy!&rdquo; he whispered, and pinched his chum&rsquo;s
arm. At once the acrobatic youth awoke and
started to speak. But Pepper put his hand over
his chum&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three persons are coming&mdash;let us lay low
and see what they want to do,&rdquo; whispered Pepper.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy understood. &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; he asked,
after a few seconds of silence, during which he
peered over the guard rail of the sloop at the
three figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but I guess we&rsquo;ll soon find
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the two cadets on the <i>Alice</i> kept
quiet. In the meantime Ritter and his cronies
walked up and down the boat dock, inspecting
the sloop from that point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody on board?&rdquo; asked Paxton, in a voice
which trembled slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see anybody,&rdquo; answered Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought we weren&rsquo;t to do any talking,&rdquo; came
from Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll shut up&mdash;if anybody appears,&rdquo; said
the leader of the unworthies.</p>
<p>With great caution they got out a rowboat and
entered it. Then they poled silently to the side
of the <i>Alice</i> and peered over the guard rail.
Andy and Pepper were out of sight, under some
sailcloth. But their eyes and ears were on the
alert in the semi-darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the coast is clear,&rdquo; they heard Ritter
say. &ldquo;Come on aboard. We can doctor up those
ropes and the rudder in no time if we get right
at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you bring your file?&rdquo; asked Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I hope you didn&rsquo;t forget yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got mine,&rdquo; put in Coulter. &ldquo;And
here is the pot of stuff for the rudder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put that drag on the keel the last thing,&rdquo;
said Ritter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to strip to do it, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it hold?&rdquo; questioned Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me for that,&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>Not without difficulty he crawled aboard the
sloop and his cronies followed. They gave a
brief look into the cuddy, but did not discover
those in hiding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let us go at the ropes first,&rdquo; said Ritter.
&ldquo;Mind, don&rsquo;t file them too thin. We don&rsquo;t want
them to break until the race is on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to put a hole in the sloop&rsquo;s bottom and
sink her,&rdquo; growled Gus Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you did that, the race would be off,&rdquo; said
Ritter. &ldquo;No, we want her to go in and lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three plotters moved to various parts of
the <i>Alice</i> and with large files began to saw on
several of the ropes used for hoisting the mainsail
and jib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we have heard enough,&rdquo; whispered
Pepper. &ldquo;You recognize them, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, Coulter and Paxton,&rdquo; said Andy,
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we dash at them with our sticks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us scare them first&mdash;make out we are officers
of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throwing the sailcloth aside Pepper and Andy
leaped to their feet, brandishing the hockey sticks
over their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender, in the name of the law!&rdquo; shouted
the Imp, in the most manly tone he could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw up your hands, or we&rsquo;ll fire on you!&rdquo;
yelled Andy, and pointed the handle of a bailing
dipper at Ritter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re discovered!&rdquo; screamed Paxton, and
dropped the file he was using. &ldquo;Oh, what shall
we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the police!&rdquo; faltered Gus Coulter. &ldquo;We
have been trapped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire!&rdquo; gasped Ritter, falling back at the
sight of the dipper handle, which gleamed slightly
in the starlight. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mean any harm.
This is&mdash;er&mdash;only a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it a joke, when you are in the
Ithaca jail,&rdquo; said Andy, in a bass voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are going to lock us up!&rdquo; screamed
Paxton. Then he gave a closer look at who was
before him. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Andy Snow!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy Snow and, yes, Pepper Ditmore!&rdquo; said
Reff Ritter, and his voice showed how disgusted
he felt over being deceived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a dipper!&rdquo; came from Coulter.
&ldquo;Think you are great to scare us, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get off of this sloop, and in a hurry,
too!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll give you
the thrashing of your lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrashing, eh?&rdquo; demanded Reff Ritter,
throwing back his black hood. &ldquo;Perhaps two can
play at that game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;and the two will be Pepper and
myself,&rdquo; put in Andy. &ldquo;Leave this sloop at
once, or take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many of you on board?&rdquo; asked Coulter,
trying to look into the cuddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they are alone,&rdquo; said Ritter. &ldquo;And
if so we are three to two. What&rsquo;s the matter
with capturing &rsquo;em?&rdquo; he added, struck by a sudden
idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capturing &rsquo;em?&rdquo; repeated his cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Then we&rsquo;ll fix it so they won&rsquo;t
squeal on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Coulter. &ldquo;Let us capture
&rsquo;em by all means!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the three unworthies advanced on
Andy and Pepper to make them prisoners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">PRISONERS ON THE SLOOP</span></h2>
<p>A short, sharp fight followed, and Ritter and
Coulter were struck over the head with the
hockey sticks. But then Andy slipped and fell
and Ritter pounced upon him. Then Coulter
attacked Pepper from the front and Paxton came
up in the rear. Suddenly Paxton pulled the
Imp&rsquo;s legs from under him, and as he went down
his head struck on the guard rail and he was
momentarily stunned. He was thrown into the
cuddy and Andy was thrown after him, and then
the tiny door was shut and bolted. To make the
temporary prison more secure the Ritter crowd
ran a heavy rope around the cuddy, just as one
would put a rope around a big box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, let us out!&rdquo; shouted Andy and began to
pound on the door loudly. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll
make it hot for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to stay in there for awhile,&rdquo; answered
Ritter, coolly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Paxton and Coulter were much excited over
the turn affairs had taken and wanted to know
what was to be done next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us talk it over,&rdquo; said Ritter. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
expect this any more than you did.&rdquo; And he
rubbed the lump one of the hockey sticks had
raised over his left ear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay Ditmore back
for that crack, see if I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he added, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got one, too, from Snow,&rdquo; growled Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better move the sloop from shore,&rdquo;
went on Ritter. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t some others may
come down and make it warm for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The anchor was hoisted and the line attached
to the dock cast off. Then they raised the mainsail
and stood out into the darkness of the lake.
Soon Putnam Hall and the boathouse were lost
in the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now lower the sail and let her drift while we
talk,&rdquo; said Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may go on the rocks,&rdquo; warned Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she does she won&rsquo;t hit hard enough to hurt.
The breeze has about died out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the cuddy Pepper had regained his senses.
With the door shut the place was suffocating, and
all the two cadets could think of was to get out.
They pounded and kicked on the door, but this
brought no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay in here!&rdquo; gasped Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to stay&mdash;unless we can break out,&rdquo;
returned his chum. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d hate to damage the
sloop to that extent&mdash;right before the race, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll damage her more yet, Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Ritter would do anything. He is
bound to make the <i>Alice</i> lose that race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several minutes went by, and the two prisoners
heard those outside walking from end to end of
the sloop. Then came a sudden jar, followed by
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Paxton is overboard!&rdquo; they heard Coulter
yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d hit those rocks so hard,&rdquo;
answered Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our time to get out&mdash;if we can!&rdquo; cried
Pepper. &ldquo;If we break the door we can have it
mended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys braced themselves against the walls
of the cuddy and put their shoulders to the door.
It could not stand this strain and in a few seconds
began to crack. Then it flew outward, over
the rope with which it had been held in, and the
cadets followed. They saw Coulter and Ritter
at the bow, bending over to assist Paxton, who
was wading in water up to his neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are loose!&rdquo; yelled Coulter, but ere he
could say more Andy grabbed him and pushed
him overboard. Pepper caught Ritter and got
that young rascal partly over the rail, but there
he clung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me, Andy!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and Andy did
so by putting his foot on Ritter&rsquo;s hand. The
bully gave a yell, and a moment later went over
backward with a loud splash.</p>
<p>The <i>Alice</i> had struck several half-submerged
rocks, but had not gone upon them. The craft
was now drifting further up the lake, leaving
Ritter, Paxton and Coulter behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho there!&rdquo; roared Paxton, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t leave us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; added Ritter and Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night!&rdquo; answered Pepper, grimly.
&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll see you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t come back, I&rsquo;ll get square, remember
that!&rdquo; yelled Ritter, in a rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you to-morrow,&rdquo; sang out Andy.</p>
<p>The rocks upon which the sloop had struck
were several in number and were backed up by
a small island situated a hundred feet or more
from the shore. Peering into the gloom those on
the craft saw the others wade out of the water
to the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are safe,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;But they are
a good mile and a half from Putnam Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;And they can&rsquo;t get ashore without swimming,&rdquo;
added Andy. &ldquo;But as their clothing is
already wet, that won&rsquo;t hurt them much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What scoundrels they are&mdash;to want to injure
this boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. We really ought to report them
to Captain Putnam and have them expelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might do that if it wasn&rsquo;t for one thing.
Remember, we have no right to be away from
the school to-night. We should have obtained
permission to watch the sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&mdash;and that will keep us from reporting
Ritter and his cronies. Just the same,
we ought to let the others know of this&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
mean Jack alone, but every one in our crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will let them know it. See, here is one
of the files they brought along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is the pot of stuff they were going
to put on the rudder, and the drag for the keel.
This drag alone would have been enough to
make the boat lose&mdash;in a close race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys, while talking, had hoisted the mainsail
of the <i>Alice</i>, and now they tacked and stood
back in the direction of the school dock. They
did not go close to shore, however, but anchored
at a point quite a distance from the boathouse.
They had towed the two rowboats along and left
them floating at the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll dare to come back?&rdquo;
asked Andy, after his excitement had died down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. If they do we can fight
them off, or sail the boat away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys lit a lantern that was on board and
by its light inspected the damage done to the
cuddy door. Fortunately the hinges had given
way and these could be renewed with but little
cost. The craft had been mussed up a little, but
that was all. Where Ritter and his cronies had
gone to work on the ropes the damage was slight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They struck on the rocks just in time,&rdquo; was
Pepper&rsquo;s decision. &ldquo;Had they kept on, these
ropes would soon have been ruined, and it would
have been too late to refit the <i>Alice</i> for that race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the boys settled down for the remainder
of the night. They took turns at sleeping
and each got a good nap if nothing more. As
soon as the first bell rang Andy went ashore,
sneaked into the school, and up to his dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any alarm?&rdquo; asked Jack, who was just getting
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just guess!&rdquo; answered the acrobatic youth.
&ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t remained on board your cake
would have been dough to-day.&rdquo; And then he
related what had occurred. Not only the young
major, but all of the others present listened with
interest. Then a rush was made downstairs and
to the boat dock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;The villains!&rdquo; was all the young major could
say. &ldquo;I really ought to expose them. But as you
say, it might get you into trouble,&rdquo; and he turned
to Andy and Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know why Ritter and his crowd are so anxious
to make you lose,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
going to mention it, but now I think it best. That
gang have put money into the hands of Crosby,
who runs the store in Cedarville, and he is putting
it up against Putnam Hall. They want to
win a pot of money, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the bitterest pill you can make them
swallow is to win the race,&rdquo; cried Joe Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I figure it,&rdquo; went on Dale.
&ldquo;Do that and you&rsquo;ll probably break them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow who bets deserves to lose,&rdquo; said Joe
Nelson, who never wagered on anything.</p>
<p>The chums wondered if they would see anything
of Ritter, Paxton and Coulter at breakfast,
but those unworthies managed to keep out of
sight. From Billy Sabine they learned that Ritter
had been excused from getting up because of
a headache, and the others had asked for permission
to make an early trip to Cedarville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are afraid to show themselves,&rdquo; said
Jack, and he was right; none of the trio mingled
with the other cadets until it was time for the
great race to come off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>It had been decided that each sloop should
carry a crew of five, and Jack had selected Andy,
Pepper, Dale and Stuffer to accompany him.
This crew went out in the <i>Alice</i> during the morning,
and learned from the judges of the race just
how the contest was to be sailed. The course
was a triangular one, exactly twelve miles in
length. The start was to be made at exactly two
o&rsquo;clock and if by six o&rsquo;clock no boat had covered
the course the race was to be declared off for the
day and was to be sailed the following Saturday,
weather permitting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">THE RACE OF THE SLOOPS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is as fine a breeze as anybody would
want,&rdquo; declared Pepper, as the <i>Alice</i> went out to
take her position for the race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Mr. Ford&rsquo;s yacht,&rdquo; came from
Andy. &ldquo;The girls are on board and so are Mr.
and Mrs. Ford and some others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sail past them,&rdquo; said Jack, and did so. All
aboard the rich man&rsquo;s craft waved their handkerchiefs
at the cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you win!&rdquo; shouted Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; added Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best!&rdquo; answered the young
major, and then sailed out of hearing distance.</p>
<p>The <i>Ajax</i> was already on hand and in a few
minutes more the <i>Neptune</i> hove in sight. Both of
the boats were in the pink of condition and caused
a murmur of admiration as they moved majestically
down to the starting position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell yez wan thing,&rdquo; said Hogan, who
was in a small boat with several others. &ldquo;Jack
has his work cut out for him this day, so he has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the other boats will surely give him a
hard push for first place,&rdquo; returned Bart Conners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the <i>Alice</i> has got to win!&rdquo; cried Harry
Blossom, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The lake front was lined with spectators and
the water was alive with rowboats, motor boats
and sailing craft of various sorts. Captain Putnam
had hired a good-sized motor boat for the
use of himself, Mr. Strong, and a dozen guests;
Doctor Pornell had a small steamer, and the immediate
friends of Bob Anderson of the <i>Neptune</i>
were out in force in a yacht that was a mass of
bunting from end to end. Flags were everywhere,
and the scene, as the sloops lined up for
the start, could not have been more animated.</p>
<p>The last directions were given by the judges,
and the three sloops commenced to maneuver for
position. Then a cannon was discharged, and
over the line shot the <i>Alice</i>, the <i>Ajax</i> and the
<i>Neptune</i>; and the great boat race was on.</p>
<p>A shout went up, lasting fully a minute. Then
the assembled multitude settled down to watch
the struggle with keen interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>The breeze was what might be termed a smart
one, and each sloop had every sail out to its
fullest. Each bow cut the water like a thing of
life, sending a fine spray over the deck. For the
occasion everybody aboard the three boats was
dressed in a suit of white duck, with white duck
hat.</p>
<p>The triangular course had been laid out to suit
the wind. Scarcely had the first half mile been
covered when the wind shifted slightly, sending
the three boats directly forward to the end of the
first leg of the race. All were making splendid
time, and when the first half of the leg was finished
they were practically abreast of each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Ajax</i> isn&rsquo;t capsizing to-day,&rdquo; remarked
Pepper, as they bowled merrily along. &ldquo;Fred
Century must have put some extra lead in her
keel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is handling her better,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;He has had plenty of practice since the
day she capsized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anderson certainly knows how to handle the
<i>Neptune</i>,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;He brought her around
too neat for anything at the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody told me he was the best sailor on
Cayuga Lake,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;To my mind, we
have more to fear from the <i>Neptune</i> than we
have from the <i>Ajax</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Just now it looks like a tie race all
around,&rdquo; murmured Stuffer. Even the excitement
of the race could not make him forget his
longing for something to eat, and he was munching
on some peanuts he had brought along.</p>
<p>On and on rushed the three sloops, until the
end of the first leg of the triangular course was
in sight. The <i>Neptune</i> was now slightly in advance,
with the <i>Alice</i> and the <i>Ajax</i> close on her
heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Neptune</i> is ahead!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;She
is rounding the stake boat of the first leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Alice</i> and the <i>Ajax</i> are a tie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the <i>Ajax</i> is ahead&mdash;she is rounding inside
of the <i>Alice</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the cries ran on. In the meantime the <i>Neptune</i>
started on the second leg of the race, with
the <i>Ajax</i> fifty yards to the rear. As said, the
<i>Ajax</i> had rounded inside of the <i>Alice</i>, thus giving
her not a little advantage over the Putnam
Hall craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; groaned Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Fred Century cut you pretty close,&rdquo;
observed Pepper to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, and if he does it again I&rsquo;ll ram our
bow into him,&rdquo; answered the young skipper.</p>
<p>As the wind had shifted, all of the craft had
to do considerable tacking on the second leg of
the course. Bob Anderson was certainly a master
at this and drew steadily to the front. Fred
Century kept second place, with Jack not more
than fifty yards behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Presently the wind appeared to grow &ldquo;choppy,&rdquo;
that is, it came and went in gusts. This did
not appear to suit the <i>Neptune</i>, and soon that
craft fell back. In the meantime, as if by magic,
the <i>Ajax</i> increased her speed and forged to the
front. At this came a wild cheering from the
supporters of Pornell Academy, and the steamer
engaged by Doctor Pornell blew her whistle
loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nip and tuck between the <i>Neptune</i> and
the <i>Ajax</i>,&rdquo; said some on shore. &ldquo;The <i>Alice</i>
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer, too,&rdquo; said one man. &ldquo;I thought she
looked as good as any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, do you think Reff Ritter put some kind
of a drag on us after all?&rdquo; asked Pepper anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the prompt answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are we falling behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunes of war I suppose,&rdquo; and the young
major heaved a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got to win!&rdquo; shouted Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll stand
a chance on the last leg&mdash;if the wind doesn&rsquo;t
shift again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>The shifting wind had ruffed up the lake
bosom not a little, and ever and anon the water
dashed over the bow of the <i>Alice</i>, wetting every
cadet on board. But the youths paid little attention
to this&mdash;they were willing to be soaked
a dozen times over if only they might win the
race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More wind coming, I think,&rdquo; said Stuffer,
pointing to some clouds that were piling up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it does come,&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;The <i>Alice</i>
is a boat for a good, stiff blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the end of the second leg was reached
the <i>Ajax</i> rounded the stakeboat first. The <i>Neptune</i>
followed at a distance of a hundred yards.
The <i>Alice</i> was now a good eighth of a mile behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we do something to catch up, Jack?&rdquo;
asked Pepper. To stand still and see the other
boats go ahead was maddening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the young skipper&rsquo;s sudden reply.
&ldquo;Stand by to shift the mainsail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All sprang to obey his order&mdash;for to do anything
was better than to do nothing. Jack had
his eyes on a spot ahead on the surface of the
lake. He was watching the water very intently
and at the same time speculating on the clouds
that were piling up to the westward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>A moment later he gave the order to shift the
sail. Over it went with a crack, and the <i>Alice&rsquo;s</i>
rudder came around like lightning. The craft
quickly veered, leaving the course taken by the
two sloops ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you are out of the course!&rdquo; shouted
Andy. &ldquo;Oh, Jack, this won&rsquo;t do at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lose ground,&rdquo; added Stuffer. &ldquo;Oh,
Jack, you&rsquo;re going wrong!&rdquo; And in his excitement
he threw several peanut kernels overboard
and stuffed the shells in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A soft spot ahead&mdash;I am going to keep out of
it,&rdquo; was the young skipper&rsquo;s answer, and he nodded
to show what he meant. &ldquo;They are in it,
thank goodness!&rdquo; he muttered, a minute later.</p>
<p>Then the others understood&mdash;and rejoiced.
The <i>Ajax</i> had run into a &ldquo;soft spot,&rdquo; so called by
sailors&mdash;that is, a place where the wind had died
away. The <i>Neptune</i> followed, and the sails of
both craft flapped idly against the masts. The
<i>Alice</i> went wide of the &ldquo;soft spot,&rdquo; and though
she felt something of the decrease in the wind,
yet Jack managed to keep her sails filled and
slowly but surely came up on a reach and overlapped
the <i>Neptune</i>. Then she forged ahead after
the <i>Ajax</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>The excitement was now intense, for only a
mile and a half of the race remained to be sailed.
The <i>Ajax</i> crawled or rather drifted out of the
&ldquo;soft spot,&rdquo; and then came forward with a rush.
The wind clouds now made themselves felt, especially
on board the <i>Alice</i>. Jack&rsquo;s face lost its
look of worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what we want!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>For half a mile it was now nip and tuck between
the <i>Ajax</i> and the <i>Alice</i>. But then the
wind increased so swiftly that Fred Century had
to lower his topsail. With all sails set the <i>Alice</i>
drew ahead, racing through the water like a
thing of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Alice</i> wins! The <i>Alice</i> wins!&rdquo; was the
cry, and this proved correct, for six minutes later
the Putnam Hall sloop came over the line the
winner by an eighth of a mile. The <i>Ajax</i> beat
the <i>Neptune</i> by less than a hundred yards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">FRED CENTURY MAKES A CHANGE</span></h2>
<p>It was a great victory for Jack and his chums,
and when they came ashore they were almost
hugged to death by their friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw you drop behind my heart went
down into my shoes,&rdquo; said Harry Blossom. &ldquo;But
when you came in ahead my heart&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climbed out of your cap, I suppose,&rdquo; finished
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about. Oh, it&rsquo;s a dandy victory,&rdquo; and
Harry&rsquo;s face fairly beamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, you did very well&mdash;very well indeed!&rdquo;
exclaimed Captain Putnam, coming up and extending
his hands. &ldquo;Major Ruddy, you have a
sloop to be proud of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proud of the <i>Alice</i>,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;She did all that I expected of her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Bob Anderson took his defeat calmly, but the
Pornell Academy students were very bitter, Roy
Bock and his cronies especially. Bock and the
others had lost considerable money on the contest
and this galled them exceedingly. They
could not understand how the <i>Alice</i> had forged
ahead when it looked as if she was beaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess Century must have stood in with the
Putnam Hall fellows,&rdquo; growled Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is absolutely false!&rdquo; cried one of the
students who had helped to sail the <i>Ajax</i>. A
wordy war followed, and in the end Roy Bock
got his nose punched, which made him more
angry than ever.</p>
<p>Ritter, Paxton and Coulter were much downcast
by the way the race had terminated. All
their plans to do Jack&rsquo;s boat an injury had failed,
and how they were going to meet their money
obligations they did not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are up against it good and hard,&rdquo; said
Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;Roy Bock is
dead sore over this. He thinks there was some
understanding between Century and Jack Ruddy.
Let us see if we can&rsquo;t get him to make some kind
of a protest, and we can back him up in it. Perhaps
we can have the bets declared off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>This plot met with instant favor at Reff Ritter&rsquo;s
hands and he lost no time in interviewing
Roy Bock. Bock did not want to run the risk of
another encounter with the Century crowd, yet
he, too, could not afford to lose the money he
had staked on the contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us talk this over all around,&rdquo; said he, and
called in several of his cronies. Later he and his
friends, with Ritter, Paxton and Coulter, went
to one of the judges of the contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think this race ought to be declared off,&rdquo;
said Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo; demanded the gentleman,
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think the <i>Ajax</i> lost the race on purpose,&rdquo;
went on Bock, and then he told of how Jack and
Fred Century were friends, and how the young
major had assisted those on the <i>Ajax</i> when that
craft had capsized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred Century does not like it at Pornell
Academy and is going to leave at the end of this
term,&rdquo; Bock went on. &ldquo;I am certain he threw
the race into the hands of the Putnam Hall cadets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Ritter boldly, and then he
spoke of a talk he had overheard between Jack,
Pepper and Fred Century. He said that there
could not be the slightest doubt but what Century
had played into Jack Ruddy&rsquo;s hands, and
Coulter and Paxton said the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>This statement aroused a hot discussion, in
which all the judges and several outsiders took
part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider every sloop was sailed honestly,&rdquo;
said one judge. &ldquo;If ever a race was won fairly
this was won by the <i>Alice</i>.&rdquo; Bock and Ritter
continued to talk, but the judges would not consider
their protest, and at last they had to withdraw
much crestfallen.</p>
<p>Bock&rsquo;s actions made a large number of the
Putnam Hall cadets very bitter, and on Saturday
night there was something of a pitched battle between
Andy, Pepper, Dale and six other of the
Putnam Hall boys and Roy Bock and his gang.
Blows were freely exchanged, and sticks and
stones were used, and Bock and his cohorts were
forced to run away. Bock got a black eye and
Grimes had two of his front teeth loosened, while
Gussic had his coat split up the back from bottom
to top. Of course the Putnam Hall cadets suffered
somewhat, but they went back to the school
happy, having driven the enemy from the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get square for this,&rdquo; said Grimes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never rest until I pay them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; returned Roy Bock. &ldquo;I wish
I could get back at the whole school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; added Gussic. &ldquo;We ought
to do something that will make the whole crowd
sore.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think up something,&rdquo; said Bock. &ldquo;Just
give me a couple of days to do it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report that Fred Century was going to
leave Pornell Academy was true. Fred was a
bright, clean-hearted lad, and the manners of
such fellows as Bock and Grimes did not please
him. More than this, when he went to Doctor
Pornell that individual treated him coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard what Roy Bock has said,&rdquo; said
the doctor. &ldquo;And I must confess I am inclined
to think that you sailed the race in such a fashion
as to please Putnam Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Pornell, this is&mdash;is infamous!&rdquo; cried
Fred. &ldquo;If you are going to side with Bock I am
going to leave this school at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; answered the master of the
academy. He was in a particularly bad humor
that morning.</p>
<p>Fred Century was as good as his word. He
walked to Cedarville that noon and sent a special
message to his father, relating what had occurred.
Mr. Century arrived at Pornell Academy
the next morning, and a warm discussion
between him and Doctor Pornell followed, lasting
an hour. Then Fred packed his trunk and
left the academy never to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;This disarranges my plans, Fred,&rdquo; said his
father, on the way to Cedarville. &ldquo;Your mother
and I were going to Rome, you know. I do not
know what to do with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;d like to do,&rdquo; answered Fred.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go to Putnam Hall. The fellows
there are bright and up-to-date, and not such
cads as Bock and Grimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; mused Mr. Century. &ldquo;Well, that
might be arranged. I know Putnam Hall has a
fine reputation. I thought of sending you there
in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage was halted, and soon it was
turned around and driven in the direction of Putnam
Hall. Arriving at that institution, Mr. Century
went in to interview Captain Putnam. When
he came out to call his son he was smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is arranged, Fred, and you are to be a
cadet here from to-day on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; cried the youth. &ldquo;That suits
me right down to the ground, father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In taking you as a pupil I think Captain Putnam
is making something of a sacrifice,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Century. &ldquo;You know of this talk
about the boat race. Well, now some folks will
cry &lsquo;fraud&rsquo; louder than ever. But Captain Putnam
says he is willing to stand by what the
judges decided, especially as he has received
word from Bob Anderson that he thinks the race
was a fair one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Fred was taken to the private office, and he
shook hands warmly with Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are doing me a favor, Captain
Putnam,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;In return I shall do all
in my power to make myself a credit to your
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all I ask, Century,&rdquo; answered the master
of the Hall. &ldquo;I presume it will not be necessary
for anybody to introduce you,&rdquo; he added,
with a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;I know about a dozen of the boys
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have your measure taken for a uniform&mdash;and
have you assigned to one of the
dormitories,&rdquo; went on Captain Putnam, and
called in one of his assistants. After Fred had
been measured and his trunk had been taken upstairs,
Captain Putnam called in Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Ruddy, allow me to acquaint you with
a new pupil, Frederic Century,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new pupil!&rdquo; cried the young major. &ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;is
Fred coming to school here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, Jack. Aren&rsquo;t you glad to have me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted!&rdquo; cried Jack, and smiled
warmly. &ldquo;But this is the greatest surprise yet,&rdquo;
he continued. &ldquo;I thought you were at Pornell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit yesterday&mdash;and mighty glad to do it.
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Fred Century was warmly welcomed by Pepper,
Andy and the others. He was put in a
dormitory next to that occupied by Jack and his
chums, the two apartments being connected by
a door which was rarely locked. He was made
to feel at home, and said over and over again
he was more than pleased over the change he had
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Pornell is as great a cad as some of
his pupils,&rdquo; said he to Pepper. &ldquo;How some of
the better class of boys can stand him is more
than I can comprehend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some folks have more money than
brains,&rdquo; answered the Imp. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the case
with many of the Pornellites, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bock is down on Putnam Hall,&rdquo; went on
Fred. &ldquo;He vows he will get square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll watch out for him,&rdquo; answered Pepper.
&ldquo;I reckon we can give him as good as he sends.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="small">A CANNON AND A FLAGSTAFF DISAPPEAR</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Andy? You look as excited as if
you had met a lion face to face.&rdquo; And the young
major sat up in bed in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hustle into your clothing and come downstairs.
Something awful has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Pepper, who had overheard
the talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cannon is gone, and so is the flagstaff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; came in a chorus from several cadets.
&ldquo;The cannon and the flagstaff gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the new cannon?&rdquo; queried the
young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I do. The old one is back in the
barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where has it gone to?&rdquo; asked Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows. It disappeared during the
night&mdash;and so did the flagstaff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did somebody chop the flagstaff down?&rdquo;
asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; anybody mane enough to do that
ought to be hung, so they ought!&rdquo; growled Emerald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they didn&rsquo;t chop it down&mdash;they dug it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And carted it off?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Come on down. You never saw Captain
Putnam so excited in his life. Peleg Snuggers
just called him up. I got up ahead of time
because I couldn&rsquo;t sleep any longer,&rdquo; concluded
Andy.</p>
<p>The news spread like wildfire, and soon cadets
were hurrying downstairs in droves, some but
partly dressed. The alarm was as great as if the
school had been on fire.</p>
<p>The beautiful brass cannon, purchased by Captain
Putnam but a few weeks before, was gone.
So was the noble flagstaff which from sunrise to
sunset floated a large American flag. On the
grass of the campus were the marks of the cannon
wheels, leading to the roadway. From the
hole left by the flagstaff there was a long, straight
mark over the grass leading to the lake front.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy to guess what was done,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;The cannon was carted off by the aid of boys,
men, or horses. Men or boys dug up the flagstaff,
hauled it down to the lake, and floated it
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Ruddy, assemble the battalion at
once,&rdquo; cried Captain Putnam. And a minute
later came the well-known rattle of the drum.
But this was not needed, for all the cadets were
already at hand, looking at the spots where the
cannon and the flagstaff had stood, and asking a
hundred and one questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen,&rdquo; began Captain Putnam,
when the two companies of the battalion stood at
attention, &ldquo;a grave lot of mischief has been done
here. You all know what that mischief is. If
any of you are guilty I want such guilty party
or parties to stand forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. The cadets looked at each
other, but not a boy budged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want no hanging-fire in this,&rdquo; went on the
master of the Hall. &ldquo;Fun is fun, but this is
going too far. Is anybody guilty or not? If
guilty, take two steps forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quartermaster will call the roll. As each
name is uttered the cadet will answer &lsquo;Guilty&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Not guilty,&rsquo; as the case may be. Quartermaster,
are you guilty or not guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not guilty!&rdquo; was the prompt reply of the
cadet who held the position of quartermaster of
the battalion.</p>
<p>The roll was speedily called and every cadet
present answered &ldquo;Not guilty,&rdquo; in a loud, clear
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is strange,&rdquo; mused Captain Putnam.
&ldquo;Can this have been done by some outsiders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, will you allow me to say
something,&rdquo; said Fred Century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred marched to the front and close to the
master of the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is the work of outsiders I think you
can blame some of the fellows of Pornell Academy,&rdquo;
said Fred. &ldquo;They are very bitter against
the cadets here and would be willing to do something
like what has been accomplished to make
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; murmured Captain Putnam, and
his face became a study. &ldquo;Have you any proofs
against them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;only I know they wanted to play
some kind of a trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a mighty poor trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>The battalion was paraded and marched into
the mess hall, and Captain Putnam jumped into
his buggy and drove over to Pornell Academy.
He received a very cold reception at Doctor Pornell&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pupils are young gentlemen, never guilty
of such rascality,&rdquo; said the doctor, haughtily. &ldquo;I
do not deem it necessary to question them concerning
it.&rdquo; And that was all the satisfaction the
master of Putnam Hall got.</p>
<p>The cadets had to go to their studies after
breakfast, but directly the school sessions were
over for the day, many formed searching parties
and went forth hunting for the missing cannon
and the flagstaff. Jack headed a party composed
of Pepper, Andy and Dale, to look for the
cannon, while Fred Century took out Bart Conners
and Emerald in the <i>Ajax</i>, to look for the
flagstaff.</p>
<p>For a short distance along the road Jack and
his chums could see the marks of the cannon
wheels quite plainly. But further on the road
was rocky and hard, and there the tracks could
not be told from those made by wagons and automobiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a good deal like looking for a pin in
a haystack,&rdquo; observed Pepper, as they came to a
halt at a cross roads. &ldquo;The question is, Did they
keep straight on, or turn to the right or left?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d dare to take the cannon
to Cedarville,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Somebody would be
sure to see them and tell Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Andy is right,&rdquo; put in Dale. &ldquo;They
must have gone to the right or the left with the
piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road to the right runs down to the lake
front, and it is soft and muddy. They&rsquo;d not be
likely to go that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless they dumped the cannon into the
lake,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d dare do that,&rdquo; said Dale.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be afraid of arrest if found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they must have gone up into the
woods,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Let us hunt in that direction
first anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets were now joined by others, until a
crowd of at least twenty were following the road
leading through the woods to Benson Pond. For
a distance the road was rocky and hard, then it
grew soft, and they beheld the tracks made by the
cannon quite plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! we are on the right road!&rdquo; cried the
young major.</p>
<p>So anxious was the crowd to locate the cannon
that nearly all started on a run. They had
to pass directly under some heavy, overhanging
trees, and then came to where there was a stony
cliff and something of a shale road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the tracks of the cannon any
more!&rdquo; cried one cadet, and soon the others said
the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till we reach some spot where the road
is soft,&rdquo; suggested Dale, and trudged along hopefully
for quarter of a mile. Here they came to
the edge of Benson Pond and the roadway was
muddy; but the cannon tracks were nowhere to
be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve missed it,&rdquo; said Jack, with something
of a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us retrace our steps and look on both
sides of the road,&rdquo; suggested Pepper. &ldquo;Maybe
we&rsquo;ll find out just where they left the road. They
may have hauled the cannon right into the middle
of the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked back slowly, scattering to both
sides of the highway. But not a sign of the cannon
tracks was brought to light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly a mystery,&rdquo; sighed Dale.
&ldquo;The tracks seem to fade into thin air. Now
they couldn&rsquo;t make the piece disappear like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless they blew it up,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, do you think they did that?&rdquo; cried
Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve got an idea and I am going
back to where we saw those tracks last.&rdquo; And
the young major stalked off, followed by the
majority of the others.</p>
<p>Reaching the place mentioned, Jack began a
close inspection of the ground. Then he moved
on slowly, looking first at the ground and then
at the trees overhead. Thus he covered several
hundred feet, stopping at a spot where the roadbed
was a solid mass of rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the cannon!&rdquo; he cried suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found it?&rdquo; came from a dozen others, and
they rushed to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up in yonder tree. They hauled it to this
spot, tied it to two big ropes, and pulled it up into
the tree. There it is now, shining out between
the leaves!&rdquo; And the young major pointed in
triumph to the discovery he had made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">A CONFERENCE OF IMPORTANCE</span></h2>
<p>The cannon was there, true enough, and as
they viewed the piece the cadets present set up a
cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been quite a job to hoist the
cannon into the tree,&rdquo; observed Pepper, as he
gazed at the object, which was suspended fully
fifteen feet over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so difficult as you think, Pep,&rdquo; answered
Andy. &ldquo;All they had to do was to throw the
ropes over a couple of strong limbs, tie the ends
to the cannon, and hoist away. If they had
horses&mdash;and I think they had&mdash;it was easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is, How are we to get the cannon
down, now we have found it,&rdquo; said another
cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I see if the ropes have been cut short
or simply wound around the tree limbs,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;Somebody give me a boost into
the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>He was soon up in the branches, and then he
announced that the ropes were sufficiently long
to lower the cannon to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll have to work with care,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;For if the cannon should slip somebody may get
hurt,&mdash;and, besides, the cannon would be damaged
by falling on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half a dozen cadets climbed up into the big
tree. The cannon weighed seven or eight hundred
pounds and was dangling by several feet of
the two ropes. The ropes were slipped into two
crotches of the tree and then wound around
a part of the trunk. With care the boys loosened
the fastenings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let down an inch at a time,&rdquo; ordered the
young cadet. &ldquo;If you find the rope slipping catch
it in the crotch and wind tight at once. Don&rsquo;t
take any chances, for Captain Putnam would
never forgive you if you smashed the cannon. It
cost a neat penny, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly and cautiously the cadets in the tree,
assisted by some who had hold of the ends of the
ropes below, lowered the cannon to the rocky
roadbed. Then all gathered around to inspect
the find. It seemed to be in perfect condition, for
which they were thankful.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="center"><span class="small">THEY LOWERED THE CANNON TO THE ROCKY ROADBED.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>With all the boys pulling on the rope it was
an easy matter to haul the cannon in the direction
of Putnam Hall. As they approached the
campus they set up a loud yell, which speedily
brought many cadets and teachers to the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; cried George Strong, as he
looked the cannon over. &ldquo;Captain Putnam will
be delighted to know you have found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out on a hunt for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fire a salute,&rdquo; suggested Pepper. &ldquo;That
will let everybody know the cannon is found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher was willing, and the piece was
quickly cleaned and loaded. Jack touched it off,
and the report echoed far and wide across the
lake and the hills around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that will tell everybody we&rsquo;re on deck,&rdquo;
cried Andy, with a happy laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they heard it at Pornell Academy,&rdquo;
said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have&mdash;unless they are all deaf,&rdquo;
said Stuffer. &ldquo;Gosh! say that work makes a fellow
hungry, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he added, and hurried
off to get a bite to eat.</p>
<p>Captain Putnam came in shortly after the cannon
was fired and viewed the piece with pleasure.
He had to smile when he heard how the
cannon had been discovered swung up in the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly a schoolboy&rsquo;s prank,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
not the kind I admire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Fred Century and the others on the <i>Ajax</i> did
not come in until dark. They had hunted along
the lake shore for several miles, but without success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they hung the flagpole in a tree, too,&rdquo;
suggested Pepper, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not likely,&rdquo; answered Bart Conners.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be more apt to weight it down with
stones and sink it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you look in the water along shore?&rdquo;
asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did in some spots, but not in all. We can
go out again,&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>To keep the flag afloat that day Captain Putnam
had a rope run from the school building to a
nearby tree. He said he would wait a week and
see if the flagstaff could not be found and then
would order a new one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I can find out who took the old one
I&rsquo;ll make them pay for it,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Several days slipped by, and then Staffer came
to Jack and Pepper while the others were in the
gymnasium exercising.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve discovered something,&rdquo; said Stuffer, and
then related how he had been down to Cedarville
on business and had overheard Roy Bock and
several other students talking at the steamboat
dock. He had not overheard all that was said,
but had heard enough to make sure that Bock
and about twelve other students from Pornell
Academy had come over to Putnam Hall at midnight
and removed the cannon and the flagstaff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think it is a mighty good joke,&rdquo; said
Paul. &ldquo;I wish we could pay them back for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it, Stuffer!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;I was
just waiting to make sure Bock and his gang were
guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you learn anything about the flagstaff?&rdquo;
asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took it somewhere down to Rock Point
and sunk it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, the best thing we can do is to
go after it and tow it back,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>They visited the Point the next afternoon and
after some trouble located the flagstaff. It was
in several feet of water, and held down by two
old doors loaded with stones. Once the stones
were rolled away, doors and flagstaff came to the
surface instantly. Then the big pole was fastened
to the stern of the <i>Alice</i> and towed to the Putnam
Hall dock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fire another salute, to celebrate the return
of the flagstaff!&rdquo; cried Andy, and this, with
Captain Putnam&rsquo;s permission, was done. The
cadets insisted upon planting the flagstaff themselves,
just as it had been before, and the work
was accomplished under Captain Putnam&rsquo;s personal
directions. Around the foot of the pole
they dumped some rocks and poured in a quantity
of cement to bind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, they&rsquo;ll never take that pole up again,&rdquo;
said Jack, and they never did, for the flagstaff
stands on the campus of Putnam Hall to this
day.</p>
<p>That night a special meeting was called in the
dormitory occupied by Jack, Pepper and others.
About a dozen cadets were invited to be present,
including Fred Century, and not a one was absent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This meeting is called for the purpose of discussing
ways and means of squaring accounts
with the Pornell Academy students,&rdquo; said Pepper,
who presided. &ldquo;They had the audacity to
come here at midnight and steal our cannon and
our flagstaff. We owe them something. Are we
going to pay &rsquo;em back or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay &rsquo;em back!&rdquo; was the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With interest,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compound interest,&rdquo; said Dale, and this made
everybody laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have here a fellow cadet who was once
a student at Pornell,&rdquo; continued Pepper. &ldquo;He
knows the buildings and the grounds thoroughly.
He is willing to tell us all he knows, and will even
lead us if we say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Fred Century,&rdquo; cried one cadet.
&ldquo;May he live as long as his name implies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been at some pains to question Fred
concerning Pornell Academy and he says they
have in the building one room devoted to trophies
of all sorts&mdash;flags, banners, silver cups, a statue,
and so on, which the various teams and clubs of
the school have won from time to time. It has
been suggested&rdquo;&mdash;here Pepper drew down the
corners of his mouth in such a fashion that everybody
knew the suggestion was his own&mdash;&ldquo;It has
been suggested that somebody might go over
there some night and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clean the room out!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Just the
cheese!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as done,&mdash;provided Fred will
show us where that room is,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the greatest of pleasure,&rdquo; was Fred Century&rsquo;s
answer. &ldquo;It is on the north side of the
building, next to Doctor Pornell&rsquo;s private office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we don&rsquo;t want to hurt any of the
things,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t run off with them
as they did with the cannon and the flagstaff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can take sacks along and some excelsior,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t go in for breaking or
scratching anything myself. And, oh, say!&rdquo; he
cried suddenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a dandy hiding place
for them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that after we have the stuff out of
the school. I am sure you will all agree with
me the hiding place will be the best ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a tree?&rdquo; queried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much! This is something better,&rdquo; said
the Imp.</p>
<p>The matter was talked over for half an hour,
and then it was decided that the raid on the Pornell
Academy trophy room should take place the
following night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">IN THE TROPHY ROOM</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Are we all here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come along. And don&rsquo;t make any noise
on your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were spoken in whispers. Following
them came silence, and like so many
shadows fourteen forms crept downstairs and
out of a side door of Putnam Hall. They made
directly for the boathouse dock. The boys were
in their socks, and did not attempt to don their
shoes until safe in the boathouse.</p>
<p>Three rowboats were in readiness, and as
quietly as possible the cadets entered them and
shoved off. Into the water dropped the oars;
and the three craft were headed for Pornell
Academy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have gone in the sloops, but there
is no telling about the wind,&rdquo; said Jack, when
he felt it would be safe to talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can row as well as not,&rdquo; answered Andy.
&ldquo;The exercise will do us good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope it stays clear until we get back,&rdquo;
said Pepper, with an anxious look at the sky,
where the clouds were beginning to hide the stars
from view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, are you sure Mumps or some
other sneak isn&rsquo;t on to our game?&rdquo; asked Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a risk we had to run,&rdquo; answered Bart
Conners. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mumps knows of this,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly all of the boys were good oarsmen, and
by their united efforts the three boats moved
swiftly over the bosom of Cayuga Lake. Not
another craft seemed to be stirring, and the
night was as quiet as a graveyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming in sight of the Pornell dock,&rdquo;
said Jack, at last. &ldquo;Now, Fred, you&rsquo;ll have to
lead the way, for you are the only one who knows
all about this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; answered the youth who had once
been a Pornell Academy student.</p>
<p>The midnight prowlers left their rowboats tied
up at the dock and followed Fred Century to the
campus of the school and then to a doorway leading
to the basement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;This door is locked, but the servants usually
leave the key on the window,&rdquo; whispered Fred.
&ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo; He took the key and unlocked the
door. &ldquo;Shall I go in alone and open the window
to the trophy room, or do you want to come in
this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better go in alone,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;We might stumble over something in the dark
and make a noise. Where is the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down there&mdash;the fifth window from here.
You had better hide until I open the blinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; whispered Pepper.</p>
<p>Carrying the bags and the excelsior they had
brought along, the cadets retreated, leaving Fred
to enter the school building alone. Fred closed
and locked the door after him. Then the cadets
outside crouched down behind some bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he isn&rsquo;t caught,&rdquo; whispered Andy.
&ldquo;Somebody might take him for a burglar and
shoot at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a light in one of the upper rooms,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;That looks as if somebody was up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes the light out,&rdquo; answered Dale, a
moment later.</p>
<p>With their hearts beating rapidly, the cadets
waited. Now that they had really embarked on
the midnight expedition they began to realize
what a great undertaking it was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we are caught, Doctor Pornell may have us
all locked up,&rdquo; said one boy who was extra nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to withdraw you can do so,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;Everyone to take part here must
do so of his own free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell yez what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;If
an alarm comes run for the lake for all ye are
worth!&rdquo; And this was agreed upon by all.</p>
<p>Five minutes passed&mdash;to the waiting cadets it
seemed much longer than that&mdash;and still they
heard nothing from Fred. They gazed at the
blinds of the trophy room anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he has been caught and those inside
are waiting to collar us, too,&rdquo; suggested Harry
Blossom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have had to wait for somebody,&rdquo; returned
Jack. &ldquo;Remember that light we saw upstairs.
That might have been a monitor or
teacher going around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later they saw one blind open
softly and then the other. Then Fred&rsquo;s head
appeared in the semi-darkness and he beckoned
to those outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a
sound. I think one of the teachers is still up. I
heard him talking to somebody and he said something
about a toothache.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Confound his toothache!&rdquo; murmured Pepper.
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t he go to bed and go to sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he would if he could,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose he is staying up with a toothache
for the fun of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As silently as possible one cadet after another
climbed in at the window. When all were inside,
the blinds were closed and the curtain drawn
and then lights were lit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you lock the door to the hall?&rdquo; asked
Jack of Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;and hung a bit of paper over the key-hole,
too,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>Without delay the midnight visitors unfolded
their bags and got ready the excelsior. In a very
few minutes&mdash;for all worked with nervous
haste&mdash;<a id="rfront" href="#front">they had packed away nearly every trophy the room contained.</a>
These included three flags, four
banners, four silver cups, a gold tankard, a bronze
statue of a bowler, a marble statue of an oarsman,
a bronze tablet containing the names of the
school champions for several years back, two
decorated canoe paddles, and several other
trophies of more or less importance.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Moving day! moving day!</p>
<p class="t0">Now is the time to get away!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>sang Pepper softly, as he tied up his bag of stuff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered Jack, sternly. &ldquo;Remember,
we are not out of it yet. You can sing when
we are on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as mum as a mule with the lockjaw,&rdquo;
said Pepper, with a grin.</p>
<p>The trophy room was now totally bare excepting
for several small rugs and a table. The rugs
Andy began to roll up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well finish up the job in first-class
style,&rdquo; said the acrobatic youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we leave a card behind?&rdquo; asked Dale.
&ldquo;Compliments of Putnam Hall, or something like
that?&rdquo; questioned Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something better than a card,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;Just set that little table out in the
middle of the floor.&rdquo; And as some of the others
did as requested he took from his pocket two
small objects and placed them side by side on the
table top. One was a toy cannon about two
inches long and the other was a lady&rsquo;s hatpin with
a small American flag attached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! just the thing!&rdquo; cried several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better,&rdquo; added Andy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
know where they came from right enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; came suddenly from Hogan. &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;m afther hearin&rsquo; footstheps in the hall.
Douse the glim!&rdquo; And he suited the action to
the words by putting out the lights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>All became as silent as ghosts and listened intently.
They heard footsteps outside, coming
nearer and nearer. They fully expected somebody
to try the door, and wondered what would
happen after that. But presently the footsteps
died away in the other direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody going to the kitchen!&rdquo; whispered
Fred. &ldquo;Guess it is the teacher who had the
toothache. Maybe he wants to get some boiling
water, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are about ready to go, so why linger?&rdquo;
asked Stuffer.</p>
<p>With caution the blinds were again opened.
The coast looked to be clear and they dropped to
the campus outside, one at a time, and each with
a bundle. Fred was the last to come out, and
before doing so he unlocked the door to the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a surprise there in the morning,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon they&rsquo;ll find out they have been paid
back in their own coin,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>Closing the window and the blinds, the cadets
hurried to their boats and were soon out on the
lake. Then Pepper told them of the place he had
in mind for storing the trophies. That was a
deserted house half way between Pornell Academy
and Putnam Hall, and on the lake shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;The best possible place,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;The
house is supposed to be haunted and nobody ever
goes there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rowing swiftly, the cadets soon reached the
vicinity of the so-called haunted house. They
took their bags ashore and carried them up to
the old dwelling, which was almost ready to fall
down. In an upper room they found a big clothing
closet and in this they placed all the trophies
and closed and barred the door on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let the Pornellites find them&mdash;if they
can,&rdquo; declared Pepper. &ldquo;I rather think they&rsquo;ll
have a long hunt to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the cadets hurried back to the lake, rowed
to the Putnam Hall dock, and lost no time in
creeping into the school and up to their dormitories.
Five minutes later all were in bed and
trying to get to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">AN UNLOOKED-FOR DISAPPEARANCE</span></h2>
<p>The excitement at Putnam Hall over the disappearance
of the cannon and the flagstaff was
fully duplicated at Pornell Academy when it was
discovered that the trophy room had been looted
of its entire contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an outrage!&rdquo; stormed Doctor Pornell.
&ldquo;An outrage! I shall put somebody in prison
for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has been left behind,&rdquo; said a
teacher who chanced to be with the doctor. &ldquo;A
toy flag and a toy cannon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See for yourself, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! I understand! A flag and a cannon indeed!
This must be some of Captain Putnam&rsquo;s
work&mdash;to pay me back for the loss of his cannon
and his flagstaff,&rdquo; stormed Doctor Pornell.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about it! I&rsquo;ll have somebody in jail before
night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>The news soon spread, and great was the indignation
among the students and especially
among those who had helped to win the trophies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have only been paid back for what
we did,&rdquo; said one pupil, who had aided Roy Bock
in the removal of the cannon and the flagstaff.
&ldquo;Those who play with fire mustn&rsquo;t complain if
they get their fingers burnt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must find those trophies,&rdquo; declared another.</p>
<p>A hunt was made that day and also the next.
In the meantime Doctor Pornell sent a decidedly
sarcastic letter to Captain Putnam. This angered
the master of Putnam Hall exceedingly, and he
sent an equally sarcastic letter in return; and
there, for the time being, the matter rested,&mdash;so
far as the Putnam Hall students were concerned.</p>
<p>But it did not rest with Roy Bock and his immediate
cronies. In some manner Doctor Pornell
learned that Bock had concocted the scheme
to take away the cannon and the flagstaff, and
consequently he considered Bock responsible for
the removal of the trophies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your friends who took part in this
disgraceful affair must get back those trophies,&rdquo;
said the doctor to Bock. &ldquo;If you do not I shall
punish you severely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I will do what I can,&rdquo; stammered Bock,
who was so chagrined over being found out that
he knew not what to say. That afternoon he and
his cronies went out on another hunt for the
missing things, but without result. They passed
the deserted house, but did not go inside. Had
they done so they might have seen something
which would have amazed them exceedingly, for
the old building now had strange visitors.</p>
<p>Some days after the trophies were removed
from Pornell Academy Jack and Pepper were
out in the <i>Alice</i> when they saw a youth in a rowboat
pulling up the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Will Carey,&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Let us
sail over to him and find out if he has done anything
about Flossie Ford&rsquo;s bracelet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They caught Carey just as he was starting to
fish. It was a favorite amusement with the Pornell
Academy student and he took every available
opportunity to indulge in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Carey!&rdquo; sang out the young major, as
he brought the sloop around and told his chum
to drop the mainsail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello yourself,&rdquo; returned the other youth,
not particularly pleased over the meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is everything at Pornell Academy?&rdquo;
questioned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you fellows know well enough. Did
a big thing, didn&rsquo;t you, to steal all our trophies?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are your trophies gone?&rdquo; asked the Imp, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they are&mdash;and you fellows know it. You
cleaned us out nicely I must say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very, very sorry, Carey,&rdquo; and Pepper
grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trophies, eh?&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;When did
Pornell ever win any trophies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he means the trophies they bought at
some junk shop,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;You know you
can buy all kinds second-hand, for about twenty
cents apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These were trophies our school won!&rdquo; exclaimed
Will Carey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From who&mdash;some primary school, or kindergarten
class?&rdquo; asked the Imp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can win &rsquo;em&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll find it out
some day,&rdquo; growled the student from Pornell
Academy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Carey, we didn&rsquo;t come over here to
ask you about your trophies,&rdquo; said Jack, earnestly.
&ldquo;We want to know what you have done
about Flossie Ford&rsquo;s bracelet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you drop that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;We could&mdash;but we are not going to,&rdquo; declared
the young major. &ldquo;You must find that bracelet
if you possibly can. Have you fished for it any
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Will Carey paused and looked
at Jack and Pepper doubtfully. &ldquo;Say, did I hear
something about your meeting two masked men
around here?&rdquo; he went on earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you did&mdash;but what has that got to
do with the bracelet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything. Did the men have green masks
and hoods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they must be the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They robbed me of the bracelet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed you!&rdquo; cried Jack and Pepper in
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said you had lost the bracelet&mdash;that
it fell in the lake,&rdquo; said the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph, I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Bone and Blood Club, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are. Now what about this bracelet and
the two masked men?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a couple of days after you caught me
I went fishing for the blue tin box again and
found it. The bracelet was inside and all right.
I took it out and started for the Ford place, intending
to give it back to Flossie. On the road
I met those two masked men, and they held me
up and took the bracelet and a ruby ring away
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; asked Pepper. &ldquo;You are sure
you are not fooling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the positive truth&mdash;hope to die if it isn&rsquo;t.
The men had clubs and one had a butcher knife,
and I admit they scared me half to death. They
acted as if they were about half crazy. One said
he was going to give the bracelet to the queen of
the North Pole, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that Will Carey did not hesitate to give
the particulars of the encounter on the road. His
description of the two insane men was so perfect
it left no doubt in the minds of his hearers regarding
the truth of the recital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could catch those chaps,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;But they said if I told anybody they would come
to the school and butcher me some night, so I
haven&rsquo;t dared to open my mouth. Besides, I
didn&rsquo;t want to let Doctor Pornell know about the
bracelet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say they had clubs and a butcher knife,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and each of &rsquo;em had a couple of white
bags over his shoulder, stuffed with excelsior and
other things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; almost yelled Jack and Pepper in
concert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White bags. They had something in &rsquo;em
wrapped in excelsior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the back road&mdash;over yonder,&rdquo; and Will
Carey pointed with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! We&rsquo;ll have to look into this,&rdquo; said
the young major and looked meaningly at his
chum. &ldquo;We are in a hurry now. We&rsquo;ll see you
later, Carey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But about those crazy men?&rdquo; began the Pornell
Academy student. He did not understand
the sudden haste of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The authorities are already watching out for
them,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Run up the mainsail
again, Pep,&rdquo; he continued to his chum, and the
<i>Alice</i> moved away from that locality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, do you imagine those bags were our
bags?&rdquo; demanded Pepper, when they were out of
hearing of the Pornell student.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know. I am going to sail for the
deserted house at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said they were stuffed with excelsior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is what made me suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>The run to the vicinity of the old mansion did
not take long. Reaching what was left of an old
dock, they tied up, and almost ran to the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody around now, at all events,&rdquo; observed
the young major, as they glanced through the
lower rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but somebody has been here, Jack&mdash;by
the muddy footprints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wondering if their suspicions would prove
correct, they mounted to the second story of the
old mansion and ran into the room in the closet
of which the trophies had been stored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty!&rdquo; gasped Pepper, peering inside the
closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every bag gone!&rdquo; echoed Jack. &ldquo;Those crazy
men must have carted them all away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they take the things to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be found out. And if we
can&rsquo;t find the things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The young major
paused. &ldquo;Well, somebody will have a fine bill to
pay, that&rsquo;s certain!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">THE HILL CLIMBING CONTEST</span></h2>
<p>That night Jack called a special meeting of the
cadets who had participated in the removal of
the trophies from Pornell Academy. This took
place in the gymnasium, and every possible care
was taken to exclude outsiders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in a pickle,&rdquo; admitted the young
major. &ldquo;Events have taken an unexpected turn,
and what we had best do I do not know.&rdquo; And
then he told everything, how Will Carey had
been robbed of the bracelet and his ring, and how
the crazy men had carried off all the bags of
trophies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper and I did our best to trace the men,
but we could not do it,&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;We
found some whisps of excelsior on the road, and
some footprints, but not enough to follow to the
end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>The loss of the trophies carried consternation
to everybody present, and the boys felt more than
blue as they discussed the situation. They had
expected to return the trophies to Pornell Academy
in secret in the near future. Some were in
favor of going to George Strong with their story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crazy men are his relatives,&rdquo; said one.
&ldquo;He ought to do all in his power to locate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we go to him Captain Putnam will find out
that we took the trophies,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;And we
don&rsquo;t want that to happen&mdash;at least not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we wait before we do anything,&rdquo; said
Dale. &ldquo;Let us all go out into the woods and
hunt for those men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get killed,&rdquo; said Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we find them we needn&rsquo;t show ourselves.
The best plan would be to watch &rsquo;em until they
go to sleep for the night and then run for help
and bag &rsquo;em before they move in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dale talks as if he had spotted them already,&rdquo;
said Bart, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you offer a better plan,&rdquo; retorted Dale.</p>
<p>It was finally decided that the cadets should
wait at least a week before going to Mr. Strong
or the authorities. In the meantime all were to
make a strong effort to locate Bart Callax and
Paul Shaff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going out every time I can get the
chance,&rdquo; said Pepper, and many others said the
same. Although they did not care to admit it,
they were much worried over the disappearance
of the trophies and wondered what they would
have to pay to get out of the scrape if the things
were not recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Doctor Pornell can make it hot for
us,&rdquo; sighed Andy. &ldquo;Hang it all! I almost wish
we hadn&rsquo;t touched the things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the meeting was breaking up a noise
was heard in one of the lockers of the gymnasium.
Pepper rushed to the door and flung it
open and confronted Mumps, who looked too
scared to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing the sneak, eh?&rdquo; cried Pepper and
yanked Mumps out on the gymnasium floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I went into the&mdash;the locker to&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To pick violets, I suppose,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;Boys, he has been spying on us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the sneak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make him promise to keep his mouth shut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say a word!&rdquo; cried Mumps.
&ldquo;I promise you I won&rsquo;t. Oh, let me go, please
let me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way with the sneak!&rdquo; cried Dale, and
pointed to the shower bath at one end of the
building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; yelled Mumps. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn the
water on me, please don&rsquo;t! I&mdash;er&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t come
here of my own free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Reff Ritter and Coulter and Paxton made
me come,&rdquo; whined the sneak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you going to report to them?&rdquo; demanded
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They made me do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll let you off on one condition&mdash;and
only one,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you don&rsquo;t breathe a word to anybody
about what has been said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you break your promise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make you wish you had never seen Putnam
Hall,&rdquo; finished Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; cried several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;positively I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered
Mumps, and then he was led to the door
and fairly kicked out on the campus. It may be
added here that he was so scared he never did say
a word until long afterward. Ritter and his
cronies tried to &ldquo;pump him,&rdquo; but the sneak put
them off by stating the meeting was held to consider
baseball matters for the coming season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>For three days, including Sunday, the cadets
roamed around the vicinity of Putnam Hall, on
the lookout for the two insane men. Occasionally
they were watched by Ritter and his
cronies and this once led to something of a fight
between Jack and the bully. Ritter received a
black eye and after that, for the time being, kept
his distance.</p>
<p>Wednesday of that week was a half-holiday,
and a number of the cadets arranged a hill-climbing
contest. This was to consist of reaching the
top of Devery Hill, three miles from the school.
The contestants were not to go by the road, but
must travel in a straight line from Putnam Hall,
over two small hills before Devery was reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is something to take the wind out of a
fellow,&rdquo; said Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t lose your wind so quickly if
you didn&rsquo;t eat so much,&rdquo; replied Andy. &ldquo;I am
going into the race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Jack says he will
go, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sixteen cadets were to participate, and they
were to start from the Hall campus at one o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon. It was a cloudy day and some
were afraid it was going to rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, who&rsquo;s afraid of a little rain,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do we take a lunch along?&rdquo; inquired Stuffer
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Onion cakes with
liver syrup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to take a sandwich anyway,&rdquo;
declared the youth who loved to eat.</p>
<p>Promptly on time the sixteen cadets lined up
for the race. All were lightly clad and in the
best of spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now remember,&rdquo; said George Strong, who
had been selected to start the racers off. &ldquo;The
boy to reach the flat rock on the top of Devery
Hill first wins the race. Are you all ready? Then
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away they went, pell-mell, across the campus,
leaping a small hedge and running up a footpath
leading to the top of the first hill. The teacher
gave them a cheer and so did Captain Putnam,
and Peleg Snuggers waved his big red handkerchief
after them. The other cadets yelled wildly
and ran along a short distance, but soon dropped
behind.</p>
<p>Ritter and Paxton were in the race. Coulter
had thought to enter, but was suffering from a
sore toe. There were to be two prizes, and the
cronies thought they could win, for both were
good runners and knew how to climb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>The distance over the first hill was a mile and
over the second hill another mile. Then came
the third mile, up to the top of Devery, a steep
incline, covered with rocks and brushwood.</p>
<p>By the time the first hill was left behind some
of the cadets were showing signs of becoming
winded. Two dropped out of the race and three
others were left far in the rear before the top
of the second hill was gained. The pace was a
smart one, and Jack, Pepper and Andy found
themselves perspiring freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more of this for me!&rdquo; came from Stuffer,
after two-thirds of the distance had been covered.
&ldquo;I am going to stop off to rest,&rdquo; and he
threw himself down on the grass under a tree.
Another cadet did likewise.</p>
<p>At the foot of the last hill Jack, Andy and Pepper
found themselves pretty well bunched. In
front of them were Ritter and Paxton. The rest
were a good bit behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to get ahead of those fellows!&rdquo;
cried the young major, and commenced to climb
with renewed vigor. Soon he passed Paxton,
who scowled darkly at him, but said nothing.</p>
<p>Pepper was close behind Jack and Andy, but
a few yards to one side, when the three heard a
noise above them. Looking upward, they saw
several stones of good size rolling down the hillside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beware of the rocks!&rdquo; sang out Jack, and
leaped aside just in time. Pepper was grazed
on the shoulder and Andy got a pinched foot.
Then they heard a yell from Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my foot! The rock has mashed my
foot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Ritter&rsquo;s fault!&rdquo; called back Jack. &ldquo;He
sent the rocks down on us! I guess he wanted to
injure me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly spoken when he heard a sudden
exclamation of terror. Ritter had slipped
and was rolling over and over down the hillside.
He passed Jack and Pepper and then came toward
Andy. The latter reached out and caught the
bully by the arm and held him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me go down!&rdquo; screamed Ritter, in
fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are safe,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;Pick yourself
up and take care of Paxton&mdash;he needs you.
Some of the rocks you rolled down struck him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it,&rdquo; stammered the
bully. But the look on his face showed that he
was not speaking the truth. He had played a
mean trick, but Fate had paid him back almost
instantly. His face was much scratched, his
wind was gone, and he had to withdraw from the
race.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">A CAPTURE&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>It had begun to rain and from a distance came
the rolling of thunder. But Jack, Andy and Pepper
paid no attention to this&mdash;their one thought
was to reach the top of Devery Hill first.</p>
<p>They had spread out along the hillside, each
seeking the easiest way up the steep rocks. Pepper
was slightly ahead, with Jack and Andy an
equal distance behind him. The other contestants
were considerably to the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in for a big thunderstorm!&rdquo; cried
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; flung back Pepper. &ldquo;I am going
to win this race no matter what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I know it!&rdquo; came from the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow to win will be the one to get there
first,&rdquo; said Andy. And then no more was said
just then, for the hill was becoming steeper and
they wanted to save their breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>At last, just as it began to rain in torrents, the
three cadets saw, fifty feet above them, the top of
the hill. To reach it each had to climb some
rocks that were now wet and slippery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break your neck, whatever you do!&rdquo;
cried Jack. &ldquo;The race isn&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am safe enough!&rdquo; panted Pepper, as he
pulled himself up with vigor. &ldquo;Hurrah, I&rsquo;m up!&rdquo;
he added, a moment later. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the rock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; shouted Andy, coming to the top
and racing off. Jack was beside him, and away
the three started for the flat rock less than twenty
yards away. They came up abreast, and all
three flung themselves on the rock simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; gasped Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; panted Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tie!&rdquo; said Jack, when he could speak. &ldquo;Creation,
but wasn&rsquo;t that last climb a corker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about rain,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;Say,
we&rsquo;ve got to get under shelter or we&rsquo;ll be soaked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something of a cliff,&rdquo; said Jack,
pointing with his hand. &ldquo;That ought to afford
some protection. Phew!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>The last exclamation followed a vivid flash of
lightning and a crack of thunder that made all
the cadets jump. They leaped in the direction of
the cliff and crouched under it. Then came another
flash and a crack, and the rain came down
in a deluge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is an opening, under the cliff,&rdquo; said
Pepper, looking around among the brushwood
growing at the base of the rocks. &ldquo;Let us get in
that. It will be some protection against the
lightning as well as the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of the youths liked the vivid flashes of
lightning and all were glad to turn into the opening,
which was a cavern between the rocks. As
they looked around them Jack&rsquo;s eye saw something
on the flooring which immediately attracted
his attention. It was some loose excelsior
and he pointed it out to his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, can it be possible those crazy men
came here?&rdquo; exclaimed Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I think it will pay us to
investigate, as soon as the storm clears away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us investigate now,&rdquo; said Pepper, impulsively.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I could get much wetter
than I am if I tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail of the loose excelsior led around the
base of the cliff and to a much larger opening
than the first they had discovered. Jack was in
advance, and of a sudden he put up his hand as
a warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked his chums, in a whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;The two crazy men&mdash;in a cave. I think they
are sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With extreme caution the cadets moved forward,
so all could look into the cave beyond.
The young major was right, there on the ground,
near a small campfire which was almost burnt
out, lay Bart Callax and Paul Shaff. Both were
sound asleep in spite of the fierce thunderstorm
that was raging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must prowl around so much in the night
that they have to sleep in the daytime,&rdquo; said Pepper,
and guessed the truth.</p>
<p>The boys looked behind the sleepers and saw
a number of bags piled in a corner of the cave.
On a rock lay the green masks and hoods and
also a butcher knife, a hatchet, and several other
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we capture them?&rdquo; questioned Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do it,&rdquo; answered the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may show fight&mdash;and they say crazy
folks are very strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take some ropes and tie them up while
they are asleep,&rdquo; suggested Pepper. &ldquo;We can
take the ropes on the bags.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>This was agreed to, and in nervous haste the
three cadets procured the ropes and advanced on
the two men who were, fortunately, sleeping
heavily. One had his hands up over his head
and it was an easy matter to tie his wrists together.
Then they secured his feet. After that
they secured the feet of the second man and
turned his arms so they could tie his wrists. At
this he awoke, but before he could collect himself
and offer any resistance he was a close prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; asked Callax, and
then of a sudden he began to weep. Shaff began
to talk wildly and offered them the Presidency
of the United States if they would set him free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mean to do you no harm,&rdquo; said Jack,
gently. &ldquo;We want to take you to your relative,
Mr. George Strong. He wants very much to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he let me play the organ?&rdquo; demanded
Paul Shaff, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the king of this mountain, and he must
come to me,&rdquo; said Bart Callax, stubbornly.</p>
<p>By talking kindly the cadets managed to soothe
the two prisoners, and then, as the thunderstorm
was passing, Andy ran out and part of the way
down the hill after some of the others who had
taken part in the race. In the meantime Jack
watched the insane men and Pepper examined
the stuff in the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;All of the trophies seem to be here,&rdquo; announced
Pepper. &ldquo;And here are the Confederate
bills and the vest taken from Mr. Chetwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything of Flossie Ford&rsquo;s bracelet?&rdquo;
asked the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a bracelet in my pocket,&rdquo; announced
Bart Callax. &ldquo;It belongs to the Empress of
China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; asked Jack, and when told,
brought the bracelet forth. By its appearance
he knew it was the one belonging to Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That clears up that mystery,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she be glad to get it back, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Will Carey will be glad it is found,&rdquo;
added the young major.</p>
<p>Later they discovered Carey&rsquo;s ruby ring on
Shaff&rsquo;s finger.</p>
<p>It was some time before Andy returned,&mdash;with
five cadets who were in the secret concerning the
Pornell Academy trophies. Those boys took the
sacks containing the things and marched off with
them in the slight rain that was falling. Then
Jack and his chums started off with Shaff and
Callax, taking the other things along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>Two hours later the two insane men were
placed in the keeping of George Strong. The
teacher was delighted to learn that they had been
found and promised to see to it personally that
the men be placed in an asylum from which
escape would be practically impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take them to the asylum myself,&rdquo; he
said, and left Putnam Hall the next day for that
purpose.</p>
<p>The reader can imagine how delighted Flossie
Ford was to get back her precious bracelet. She
was amazed when she learned the true story concerning
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this I shall take care that it never gets
away from me again,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;d lend it to me, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
asked Pepper, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe; but I&rsquo;d not lend it to anybody else,&rdquo;
answered Flossie.</p>
<p>Will Carey was also delighted and glad to get
back his ring, and when the boys asked him to
assist in getting the trophies back to Pornell
Academy he readily consented. As a consequence
the trophies were taken back one night
and placed in a row on the main dining room
table of the school, much to Doctor Pornell&rsquo;s
amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody shall suffer for this!&rdquo; he thundered.
&ldquo;Wait till I get at the bottom of this
trick!&rdquo; But he never got at the bottom of it, for
Will Carey kept his secret, being afraid that if
he did not the cadets would tell all about the
bracelet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve had some warm times this season,&rdquo;
remarked Jack, one day, when talking matters
over. &ldquo;But things seem to be quiet now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope they stay so,&rdquo; said Andy, but his
wish was not realized. Very strenuous times
were close at hand, and what they were will be
told in the next volume of this series, to be entitled
&ldquo;The Putnam Hall Rebellion; or, The
Rival Runaways.&rdquo; In that volume we shall learn
what the absence of Captain Putnam from his
school led to, and how Reff Ritter once again
tried to do Jack and his chums serious injury,
and how his rascally use of the French headache
powder was exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day we&rsquo;ll have to run that tie race off,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;As it is, we don&rsquo;t know who is
the best runner and climber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not leave it as it is?&rdquo; suggested Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; came from the young
major. &ldquo;By the way, Paxton got hurt quite badly
by the stone Ritter rolled down on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he thinks we are to blame,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;He will try to get square some day, I suppose,&rdquo;
and in this surmise the Imp was right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>The next day came a surprise that pleased the
boys very much. The Fords were to give a lawn
party and they invited about a dozen of the cadets
over. The chums went and had &ldquo;the time of
their lives,&rdquo; as Andy declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what, they are all right folks,&rdquo; said
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>And here we will leave the young cadets, wishing
them well.</p>
